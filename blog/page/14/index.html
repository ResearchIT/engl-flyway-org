	<div class="entrycontent section pad20">
<p>In this first of an ongoing series &#8220;Meet your <em>Flyway</em> Editors,&#8221; our new Managing Editor Michelle Donahue talks about talking about books, &#8220;Keeping up with the Kardashians,&#8221; and why she&#8217;s so excited for this new publication year.</p>
<div id="attachment_2192" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/michelle-donahue-180.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192" class="size-full wp-image-2192" alt="Michelle Donahue, Managing Editor" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/michelle-donahue-180.jpg" width="180" height="180" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2192" class="wp-caption-text">Michelle Donahue, Managing Editor</p></div>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: In a couple of sentences, share something about your background &#8211; writing related or not.</p>
<p>MD: I’ve got a background in science. I have a bachelors in environmental biology, have taken ecology classes in three countries, and did some National Park volunteer work in the Galapagos. I’ve had a foot (or at least a tiptoe) in both the writing and science worlds for a while now.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What book can you not stop talking to people about?</p>
<p>MD:<em> The Poisonwood Bible</em> by Barbara Kingsolver. Old news, I know, but I finally read it this summer, and though I’ve read quite a few things by Kingsolver, this is my new favorite. I love the shift in perspectives, the lyrical prose, and the way she captures the wonder and horror of being trapped in a foreign place. We need more novels that focus on faraway places so carefully, so compassionately.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What book inspires or compels your writing?</p>
<p>MD: <em>The Blind Assassin</em> by Margaret Atwood. I’m a big Atwood junky, but this resonates with me because it’s so many things all at once: historic fiction, sci-fi, good ‘ole literary fiction. My writing is really driven by outside sources and sometimes that’s science or history or religion, but it’s hard to balance real-life fact with the fictional momentum of a piece. I’m also drawn to non-linear narratives and stories that always keep you on your toes, keep you guessing.  <em>Blind Assassin</em> does all of the above and does it in a sly, not-pretentious way. In many ways it’s been my almanac of how to write.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What (other than Flyway) literary magazines do you read?</p>
<p>MD: <em>Glimmer Train</em>, <em>The Beloit Fiction Journal</em> and <em>Ecotone</em> have been long time favorites. I also read a lot of online journals, like <em>Paper Darts</em>, <em>Diagram</em>, <em>[PANK]</em>, <em>NAP</em>, <em>Birdfeast</em>, <em>THRUSH</em>, <em>Fiddleback</em>, and <em>Brevity</em>.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</p>
<p>MD: I don’t really search for specific writers, I usually just bounce around and read whatever peaks my interest. Lately, I keep coming across stories by Lauren Groff and I’ve loved everything of hers.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Is there an aspect of the writing life, or the writing industry, that deserves more attention than it gets?</p>
<p>MD: I have these magnificent dreams of a world where poetry is as widespread as something like, let’s say, &#8220;Keeping up with the Kardashians.&#8221; Although really high quality fiction and nonfiction can make it into pop culture, I wish poetry had the spotlight more often. And really in this instant gratification, 150 character, fast paced time, you’d think poetry would be the go-to form of reading. Quick, powerful, BOOM. It blows you off your feet in a way that &#8220;Keeping up with the Kardashians&#8221; just can’t.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What advice do you have for potential-contributors of Flyway?</p>
<p>MD: We really are open to broad, strange, sideways takes on the “environment.” Although I love a good wilderness work with sweeping Steinbeck setting descriptions, I’m more intrigued by something a little different. Show us something with a little whimsy or grit. Show us an urban environment, an anti-environment, a volcanic, crepuscular, moonscape environment. Also, read some work from <em>Flyway</em> before you submit to see what we’re all about. It’s free! Also, please read our submission guidelines and label your work with the correct genre. A writer that can’t read is worrisome indeed.</p>

	<div class="entrydate">3 Sep 2013</div>
		<br class="clear">
	</header>
	<div class="entrycontent section pad20">
<p>Kimberly Jean Smith won Flyway’s “Sweet Corn Fiction” contest with her piece “Lucette.”  She was gracious enough to share with <i>Flyway </i>editors some of her thoughts on environmental writing, artistic creation, and wildness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2181" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/KimberlySmithBioPhoto.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181" class="size-medium wp-image-2181" alt="Photo by Pamela Schwarz" src="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/KimberlySmithBioPhoto-580x386.jpeg" width="580" height="386" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/KimberlySmithBioPhoto-580x386.jpeg 580w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/KimberlySmithBioPhoto.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2181" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Pamela Schwarz</p></div>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: Could you give us some background for “Lucette”? How did art, specifically, Van Gogh’s art and history inspire your story?</p>
<p>KJS: Well, I think Van Gogh’s work probably infused my psyche in ways that I’m not even aware.</p>
<p>For example, I know I worked for years at the Writing Center on my community college campus, and we had decorated one wall with a large dusty print of Starry Night. It was faded, the colors no longer true, and it hung in a somewhat battered plastic frame because that was the decoration we could afford at our center. Every morning I walked in and saw that until I was not even aware I was seeing it anymore.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until long after “Lucette” was written that I even remembered encountering that picture like that, every single time I walked into to work!</p>
<p>Also, I once saw an advertisement for a credit card. It featured Starry Night as one of a number of background designs you could choose for a card they were featuring.</p>
<p>So things like that, I think they leak in and mix with other things.</p>
<p>Things like, a longtime ago I saw a documentary about a very large gold mine in Brazil. It documented in vivid detail the labor of the place, the men climbing up from the bottom of a deep pit covered in mud with heavy bags of soil on their backs. The film included a group of women, living in nearby shacks, who serviced the miners with sex and perhaps other comforts. The women’s look of absolute boredom, the threadbare curtains between their rooms, their isolation, and what I imagined was a kind of unity between them stuck with me.</p>
<p>But more than anything, it was Adam Gopnik’s story about the night Van Gogh lost his ear, which ran a few years ago in the New Yorker that led to an awareness of my fictional Lucette.</p>
<p>It’s hard to know why. Gopnik’s story was very consumed with the details of Gaugin’s relationship to Van Gogh. In passing he mentioned the women of the Little Yellow House, and in particular a woman named Rachel.</p>
<p>That stuck out to me. I mean, at the time, neither painter was a man of note, maybe just messy hard workers like the miners, though they labored over canvases, which is a source of freedom no matter how poor you might be.</p>
<p>Now Gaugin and Van Gogh hold such large presences in our culture. I imagine it would have surprised the women whose time and attention they bought, and I wondered what those women would have had to do in their lives to warrant an article like Gopnik’s.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I put the magazine down, and the room seemed different. Maybe there was a little vibration, and then Lucette was just somehow there, an artist who’d lost sight and lived without ever having access to an artist’s materials.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sweetcorn2-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2179" alt="sweetcorn2 (2)" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sweetcorn2-2-580x435.jpg" width="580" height="435" /></a></p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: “Lucette” is set in and near Arles, France, and you have some striking setting descriptions, for instance, “<i>Meadows, then woods, dark vibrating tree bark, red pointed berries against white stone. One summer thousands of pale gold flowers suddenly bloomed in the grasses, surrounding the barn, each with five needle thin petals that seemed to spin in the breeze.”</i> Have you visited Arles? Or is this a more an imaginative landscape than one grounded in reality?</p>
<p>KJS: I have never been to Arles, though I have been to France a couple of times. I remember driving along and seeing open fields of sunflowers rolling on for miles it seemed, and I remember thinking in a vague kind of way, oh, so that’s where Van Gogh got that.</p>
<p>And then there’s those Courbet paintings of women working in the fields, he paid such careful attention to their clothing.</p>
<p>I tried to draw a lot of landscape details from Van Gogh’s work, the conceit being that Lucette and Van Gogh each experienced the same landscape at virtually the same historical point, and so it shaped their perception, but one was able to paint his experience and is remembered and one didn’t and she isn’t (also she’s fictional, but you get the idea).</p>
<p>Imagine all the artists in the world, who aren’t right now creating because of barriers they face. What if they were somehow able to begin creating? To what new manners of perception might we then be exposed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Flyway:</i> I’m interested in your choice to make Lucette blind. So much of your story deals with the visual, from Van Gogh’s art, to the striking French landscape, so what made you decide to make the central character blind? How did you balance describing the visual world with Lucette’s non-visual one?</p>
<p>KJS: I don’t know that I chose to make her blind. She showed up like that.</p>
<p>When I thought about her, I thought she might carry the memory of sight, and that might lead to a kind of super-vivid reconstruction of seeing, which is sort of how I experience Van Gogh’s work.</p>
<p>Instead of the balance being visual and non-visual, I think of the balance being more before and after. At one point she could see; and she carries those memories for her whole long life, and those memories attach to her experience of the world as a blind person, the way she hears, smells, touches, and tastes the world are informed by her memory of sight.</p>
<p>Like I’m guessing Van Gogh would have had a really vivid way of experiencing and recording life even without sight.</p>
<p>Maybe that isn’t true, but visual information, while certainly important for those of us with sight, isn’t the only way we experience the world. There are still all those other senses through which writers can create images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Flyway:</i> Here at <i>Flyway</i> we define “environmental writing” broadly, whether it’s writing that is strictly ecological or about environmentalism, or works, like “Lucette” where the physical environment plays an important part to the piece. How do you understand environmental writing? Do you read much environmental writing? Who are some authors who have influenced your own writing?</p>
<p>KJS: I think I have what might be a wrong idea about environmental writing––that it pits human beings against a landscape, a landscape which is always perfect prior to our arrival, and that always suffers through our presence.</p>
<p>It’s not that I love David Abram’s book, <i>The Spell of the Sensuous</i>, but I would be lying if I didn’t say it’s had a huge effect on my writing. There’s some part of me that’s always arguing against my understanding of his thesis, that we, as human beings, are failing, failing to live “rightly” I suppose, which he supports with ideas about how our very use of language leads us astray.</p>
<p>I love language and have a great faith in its powers and possibilities. But in every internal argument I have with Abram, trying to restore humanity’s good name before his harsh and judging eye, I always loop back to a position similar to his.</p>
<p>As much as language is about possibility, every word is also a kind of limitation on, or a narrowing of, our ideas about what a thing might be. I mean, once we call a tree a tree then it quickly tends to fall into all our accepted patterns for what trees can be, and, in a way, we can no longer experience a tree with any fullness. It’s become that one thing alone, and our perception is limited by whatever that word means to us.</p>
<p>Such narrowing blinds us to wonder and allows us to destroy because we can no longer experience wonder, and language is implicated in that.</p>
<p>But it sometimes seems to me that to take on the label environmentalist, ecologist, and so on, one must disavow humanity, and I love humanity. How are we that different from ants, bees, ravens, dogs, or all those other social creatures, living in close quarters and manipulating their environments to one degree or another for comfort? We are animals like that and the things we build I think arrive from similar impulses––to create more efficient connections between our fellows.</p>
<p>For the most part, I’m comfortable in cities amongst my brothers and sisters, and for me such environments are a form of nature in that we are always and forever also an expression of nature, our nature.</p>
<p>I mean, I get it, we’re have a larger effect on our environment than can ever possibly be sustained. We should do something about that, but the very impulse to build skyscrapers, ports, roads and so on, might be the animal in us.</p>
<p>I remember a story the photographer Zoe Leonard once told about her time in Alaska. She lived in a very remote area, miles and miles and even more miles from large groups of other human beings. Even so, she said for many weeks the wind continued to sound like an approaching car. It took her some time to adjust and not jump out of the way every time a strong breeze blew.</p>
<p>And then, I think it was her, who told this story, one day she came across an old dented coke can, out where no one was but her. That small sign of humanity where you would least expect if felt very comforting to her in a manner similar to how I get excited about seeing a raccoon run across a city street or smell a skunk at night––experiencing something “wild” where I didn’t expect it. Both examples somehow mean we are not alone.</p>
<p>Of course, a giant landfill of coke cans doesn’t offer any comfort, unless, of course, your income is dependent on gathering them. Then I suppose, it might look like a small mountain of gold or at least a good meal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: Could you give us insight to your writing process? Is there any writing advice you find particularly helpful?</p>
<p>KJS: I’ve stopped believing that it’s me inventing these fictional people and their worlds. It feels more as if I discover them through a careful listening, by staying silent, and not getting bossy or having too big of an agenda for a story. Rather my job is simply to record what I see and hear and that always seems more vivid than anything I could invent.</p>
<p>As long as I hold distance from what’s ending up on the page, hold true to the idea that it’s not me creating it, I find I have greater courage to really see what I see when I’m looking and hear what I hear in that space, which, I suppose, is what we call imagination.</p>
<p>I guess, and I think, imagination is a shared space. All the things that shape my seeing and hearing, which are outside of my control, they don’t have anything to do with me: that I am born a woman; and white; and I’ve read these books and not those; and have heard those songs but not others. I read certain books and hear certain songs in large part because of my social positioning.</p>
<p>I’m very influenced by Barthes’ ideas about writers, and I find what he says about how readers write a text even more than writers do very liberating. I like the idea that my cultural expresses through my genetic and sensory material, the times I was born to, and all things that are outside of my control. My part is either paying attention to or ignoring the impulse to create, or maybe it’s better to say “record” what passes through my particular set of cells at this historical time period.</p>
<p>Of course, by the time, I’m working with a draft, well, I revise carefully. I tinker and polish a lot. It feels industrious and precise, and I am very willful in that space; I want it to be “right,” whatever that means. It’s not necessarily for best ends, I suppose, but I don’t know how else to do it because I want people to read my work, I really do, and I hope they connect to it, which I think is what revision is about. Helping my imagined reader find a way into a story. Maybe revision is about seduction. Every gesture on the page matters if I can only focus my energy long enough to exact some mysterious something that others can sense as well.</p>
<p>I say all that about being a witness to imagination, but then I remember I often have an over-arching premise for my work, something that acts as a kind of constraint, a formal structure, whose terms must be met––a big agenda––as is the case with Lucette.</p>
<p>I knew it would be told in the third person, though the narration is closely aligned with her point of view, meaning I couldn’t provide a lot of visual information for large parts of the story. That was the constraint, which made the story interesting and challenging for me to write.</p>
<p>So, I guess all my artistic impulses are contradictory; these fictions are mine and not mine. I passively watch, and I maniacally polish.</p>
<p>My advice: Don’t wait for permission. Write as if all the permission you’re ever going to get has already arrived. The writing act itself is its own permission, so write whether or not it’s ugly or whether or not its good, something else is always on its way, if only you keep writing.</p>

<p><strong>Elizabeth Bradfield</strong> is the author of two poetry collections: <em>Approaching Ice</em> and <em>Interpretive Work</em>. Her poems have appeared in <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>Orion</em>, <em>The Believer</em>, <em>Poetry</em> and are forthcoming in <em>Drunken Boat</em>, <em>Alaska Quarterly Review</em> and elsewhere. She has been awarded the Audre Lorde Prize and a Stegner Fellowship, among other honors. Founder and editor-in-chief of Broadsided Press, she lives on Cape Cod and works as a naturalist and teacher.  She is the current Poet-in-Residence at Brandeis University.</p>
<p>In March, <em>Flyway</em>’s nonfiction editor Lindsay Tigue had the chance to sit down with Elizabeth Bradfield, who was in town for Iowa State University’s Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness, and the Creative Imagination.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: In your bio, you describe yourself as a “poet and naturalist.” As a naturalist participating in marine field research and in-field presentations, you also describe yourself as an “aspiring generalist.” Can you explain a little bit how you see those terms working?</p>
<p>EB: I work as a naturalist in multiple ways. I work locally on Cape Cod on short, three-hour whale watches and that’s very clear cut, but the other naturalist work I do is on expedition ships—ecotourism—so I’m with a team of other naturalists and we travel with people from a week up to three weeks in places like Alaska, the Amazon, Antarctica, and the Arctic. The “aspiring generalist” part comes in because all the naturalists I work with have their expertise and my training is not in science. I came into this work through the back door. It was always my interest though, and in college I studied marine biology, but didn’t end up with the paper to prove it. In the field, before working as a naturalist, I helped out with various projects. I spent a lot of time in the marine environment, in particular with marine mammals. And so now, the more I think about it, the less interested I am in claiming an expertise. Because I feel like the more I look, the more mystified I am. For instance, studying whales got me really interested in pelagic birds.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: It gives you a wider scope.</p>
<p>EB: Yeah. So, what I’m interested is everything (laughs). It’s the culture. It’s the nature. It’s the birds. It’s the whales. It’s the lichen. It’s the tundra ecosystem. It’s the barnacles. It’s the nudibranchs. The reason I’m interested in both poetry and natural history is I don’t want to weight them differently. They’re all interesting to me. They’re all important. And if I throw them into the big jumble and allow them to tumble around in there, then it gets interesting to me. If I try and limit myself too much and say, “I am looking at entanglement rates of gray seals on haul outs of Cape Cod.”—Yeah, I’m interested in that, but I’m not a narrow-focused kind of gal.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: It doesn’t satisfy your curiosity for everything else?</p>
<p>EB: Yeah, I’m like the dog in <em>Up</em>, looking at the squirrels. “Squirrel! There’s a squirrel over there!” My attention is distracted by something else. I want to honor that distraction, that desire to be a more traditional naturalist and person in the world—a generalist. I think being a generalist is a wonderful thing and I think in our society, we are moving toward specialization. In the medical field you see it. You also see it in other fields as well—certification programs for this, that, and the other thing. I am much more interested in <em>not</em> being certified and doing things that I’m interested in. It’s a very selfish desire! I’m doing what I want to do.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: So then my next question is how do you balance or pinball between being a poet and a naturalist?</p>
<p>EB: Awkwardly (laughs). Awkwardly. I like being a spy. Having a secret life. Here I am sitting with you and talking about poetry and, in my secret life, I’m thinking about gray seals. And when I’m in the field as a naturalist, talking about gray seals or whales or birds, then my secret life is being a poet. I don’t do both at once very well and I’ve tried to integrate them and recently I’ve been able to give a couple of talks that address that kind of jumble, talking about, in particular, Arctic science and the poems that have come from that investigation. I think I’ve been able to talk about that because I’ve come into it both as an experienced naturalist and an experienced poet. Immersing myself in the Arctic has been a place where I’ve been able to combine the two a lot more successfully. But when I’m working as a naturalist, I’m not writing poems and when I’m working on poems I don’t want to think like a naturalist per se. I want to think a lot more loosely and have language rather than consequence be at the forefront. So, I seesaw.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What role does research play in your work, if most of it is more hands-on field research or if you do a lot of book research as well? Did your research process change or differ between <i>Interpretive Work</i> and <i>Approaching Ice</i>?</p>
<p>EB: Honestly, in a weird way, I see those two first books as my one first book. A lot of the poems were written concurrently. <em>Interpretive Work</em> was finished first and accepted first and there were a few things I needed to finish up before <em>Approaching Ice</em> became a complete manuscript. Really, though, there were many years when these poems were both moving forward and accumulating and rumbling around.</p>
<p>There are two really different modes for me composing poetry manuscripts. I find myself now in a similar position. I have two manuscripts that I’m working on, one is closer to completion and the other is a little bit further away. One is more from daily life and personal experience, which is true of <em>Interpretive Work</em> and the other is more driven by a concept, a research project, some of the research being book research, some of the research in this case, unlike <em>Approaching Ice</em>, being more like investigative journalism, going to places and experiencing things. I don’t want all of those things in the same book, but I like having a project that I can move forward with, however long it takes me—five years, ten years. You know, I am working on poems about polar exploration and then these other things kind of come in and suddenly I realize, “Oh wow, I have a lot of these. Maybe they are a book…. What are they saying? What’s going on with those?”</p>
<p><em>Fyway</em>: When you’re beginning a new poem, where does the idea come from? How long of a writing process goes into each poem, or does it vary?</p>
<p>EB: I used to say—and it used to be true—that it was sound. A first line of a poem would come to me and it would be kind of incantatory and it would stick around in my head and I had to follow it. That still happens to me sometimes, but I feel like as poets it’s our job to be tuning forks, right? To be ready to resonate in one way, shape, or form. What I am interested in now are the moments of resonance that are deeply strange. I overhear something, or see something, or read something, and think, “Wow, that is really weird and a little bit messed up.” That, to me, is an exciting moment for a poem. Something I can’t wait to come home and tell my partner about: “Can you believe this?” There’s shock, uncertainty, and curiosity in a confusing, emotional jumble. Those are the exciting materials to work with in poetry.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Does it ever happen for you that what starts the poem ends up getting cut from the final version?</p>
<p>EB: Oh yes. Definitely. Some poems—a lot of poems for me—take a very long time to write. That doesn’t mean I sit down every day and work on them, but the time that I put a poem in a drawer and leave it for a month or a year, that’s important too, that sitting there and being there and letting other things happen in my life and then pulling that poem out of the metaphoric drawer and looking at it again and seeing if it still feels fresh and it still has the surprise and the weight that it felt like it did when I first wrote it. That time away is really critical for me in my writing process. Very few poems fall right onto the page.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: So it can vary, but for the most part you have to give poems a little space and come back to them?</p>
<p>EB: Space and time. I’m slow. Slow, slow, slow!</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: When reexamining your poems throughout the process of writing your two published books and your works-in-progress, how do you feel you’ve evolved as a poet? When you go back and read earlier work has anything changed in the way you approach both individual poems and large-scale projects?</p>
<p>EB: That’s a really good question. I think it’s easier—well, it’s easy to draw parallels between Book A and Book B and Book 1 and Book 2. So, if Book A is <em>Interpretive Work</em>, the collection that I’m finishing now, that I think is going to be titled <em>Once Removed</em>. Those feel in conversation to me and what’s changed from <em>Interpretive Work</em> to <em>Once Removed</em> is an interest in coldness. I mean coldness not as in a temperature the body feels, but in terms of tone. I’m not allowing my vulnerable and romantic self to be the main speaker, but my more cynical self. I’m still looking at engagements of the human and the natural world, the social self and the biological self, and how that’s all muddy and messed up. I’m still looking at family and place in the world, but with a colder eye.</p>
<p>The poems of <em>Approaching Ice</em> were very armchair-traveler poems. With this new book, I want to have a lot more at stake personally. The poems of <em>Approaching Ice</em> were the poems of an obsession. I was obsessed with this polar travel and why they did it. I didn’t have any skin in the game. I hadn’t really traveled very much to either pole. I hadn’t traveled to Antarctica at all; I’d spent a little bit of time in the north. Now I’ve spent more time there and I want to write about my own experiences more directly set against the explorers and not just judge them and imagine them, but try and have a real and felt contrast between the two.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What poets have influenced you? What contemporary poets’ work currently excites you?</p>
<p>EB: I was very lucky as an undergraduate to study with Linda Bierds. You never know when things are going to converge, but she for me is an amazing role model and poet. She was someone I had a natural resonance with, the way that she worked and the way that she approached poems. I admire her so tremendously. She’s a touchstone for me.</p>
<p>I have huge admiration for Eavan Boland—for her intellectual clarity and the grace of her lyric. Recently, I’ve been reading Stephen Dunn quite a bit and I love his hard-boiled vulnerability, the blend of cranky and romantic that he finds in his work. Anyone who can write a villanelle about Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan wins in my book. I think that’s fantastic.</p>
<p>Those are poets that are important to me and there are so many others. There are so many. Philip Larkin. Not all of his work, but some of it I find really stunning. Coleridge was really important to me as a younger writer. T. S. Eliot.</p>
<p>And now, recently, books that have just knocked my socks off have been Maurice Manning’s <em>Bucolics</em>, I think that’s a stunning book. Also, Cecily Parks’ book <em>Field Folly Snow</em>. Amazing, amazing book. I’ll read anything that Carl Phillips writes. I’ll buy all of his books. I always want to know what he’s up to. And I’ve been loving—I don’t know that they’re in a collection yet—but I’ve been really blown away by the recent work I’ve bee seeing by Ellen Bryant Voigt in <em>The New Yorker</em>. I don’t often respond to poems in <em>The New Yorker</em>, but she’s been doing these amazing, dense, winding, syntactical poems, that I just love.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: In an interview you did with Connotation Press, you said living in Alaska made you realize how important the “edge of roadlessness is to [you], how wonderful it is to walk in places where wild animals like bears and moose are present and demand your attentive respect.” I thought, since you are visiting for the Wildness Symposium, I wonder if you can talk a little bit more about your relationship to “wildness” and how it informs your work.</p>
<p>EB: I think that idea of the world demanding attention is an important one. I think this is why I enjoy spending time on boats. If you don’t pay attention to the weather, you’re an idiot. You really need to pay attention otherwise you can get into deep trouble. And that sense that you can’t enter the interior fully if you’re not attentive, you’ll become physically endangered.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What I notice for instance about being on a boat is that you focus in on different things, your ability to pay attention changes in different wild places.</p>
<p>EB: Yes.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: I just really liked that idea of demanding “attentive respect.” I think that’s something we think about a lot here in terms of, “What is wilderness, and how do you know when you’re in it?”</p>
<p>EB: Yeah and living now on Cape Cod and away from Alaska, it’s all about the water. In the woods, the predators are different. The predators are ticks and Lyme disease; they’re not bear and moose. That’s a different kind of attentiveness, but because that spit of land is so vulnerable—because it’s all sand, because it sticks out there into the Atlantic like a sore thumb, because it’s dangerously low in terms of sea level, weather and climate become their own wildness. They demand that attention. Anything in which your attention is yanked back to the physical present is wildness; whether that’s urban, or rural, or untrammeled.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: I wanted to talk a little about your editorial venture, Broadsided Press. In an earlier interview, you described it as a “literary/visual collaborative grassroots/virtual press.” Can you explain that a little? What role do you envision the combination of visual art and poetry serving?</p>
<p>EB: (laughs) It’s a long slash definition, right? I started the press in a large part out of envy. (laughs) Envy for the tools and the play and the visuals of visual art. I feel that entering an artist’s studio and they’ve got all those little rolled up tubes of paint and boxes of things—</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: It’s so tactile.</p>
<p>EB: (nods) —and you never know how it’s going to be used, but there’s this visual richness of things you can play with. If you enter a writer’s room, sure you’ll have some pictures and maybe some notebooks, but it’s boring.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Sheafs of paper (laughs).</p>
<p>EB: Yes, it’s not visible. It can be so fun to enter that visual landscape. Poetry, for me, is so important as a way of understanding the world, as a way of making sense of emotion and politics and strange moments in our lives and yet (and I think maybe this is becoming less so), it’s so shut off into a cordon of “highfalutin-ness.” That breaks my heart and I don’t think it should be that way. People are not afraid of art like they are of poetry. How can art help poetry be heard? And how can poetry inspire artists? What I wanted was to show how these forms can reverberate against each other. So the press really started because I wanted to see what visual artists would do with poems—“God, what would someone do with one of my poems? What would they see? What might happen and how can I get poetry into our visual culture in a way that will make someone stop like a poster for a band or an advertisement might?”</p>
<p>So it came from that and then also increasingly, we’ve been doing “Collaborators Q&amp;A,” where we ask the writer and the artist (who have no input over the final product once they send their stuff into me). I wanted to know how it felt to respond, to be responded to. What happens when the two come together, does it change? Is there some kind of shift that happens when the two are resting together visually on the page?</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: The MFA program here at Iowa State is unique in the fact that it is a program in creative writing and environment, which allows us students to explore interdisciplinary subjects relating to the environment that interest us, whether science, art, architecture, history. What are some of your favorite “environmental” writers? How or if you define an “environmental” writer, or would you?</p>
<p>EB: That’s a big question. Well, there are so many that I feel so indebted to. I was talking about Charles Scammons with one of the other students here. He’s an environmental writer I’m super interested in. There’s this wonderful new book out by Eva Saulitis that I’m reading, <em>Into Great Silence: A Memoir of Discovery and Loss among Vanishing Orcas</em>. I think Carl Safina does amazing books. I think Scott Weidensaul’s <em>Living on the Wind</em> is an amazing history of bird migration. I’m all over the map.</p>
<p>I’m more subject-driven when it comes to environmental reading then author-driven. When I think about writers who I really admire in terms of how they formulate a question. Richard Nelson who wrote <em>The Island Within</em> and also <em>Heart and Blood</em> about the lives of white-tailed deer in North America. I think he’s a really interesting writer because he allows the complexity to be there and he also—I think sometimes with nonfiction and environmental writing there becomes this valorization as the self as character moving through understanding and I’m very suspicious of that. I’m interested in the writers who sidestep that one way or another.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Recently, I was at the AWP conference, in the panels and readings I went to, the theme of community and its importance to poetry came up again and again—how crucial it is for fellow poets to share poems and a love of poetry and how the work of a poet can at times feel isolating, as it is work that often sees little audience beyond other poets. This is something I have been thinking a lot about lately myself, how I will retain a poetry community after the shelter of an MFA program. I am wondering what role a larger poetic community plays in your work and in your life as a poet?</p>
<p>EB: I think that idea of the journey of retreat and return in wilderness writing is also true for me in poetry. I rarely share work in progress. I have a lot of friends who are writers and talking with them generally about what we’re working on, what we’re struggling with, what we’re going to do, is really important, to feel like I have peers engaged in the work. But I don’t often look for feedback until pretty far along in the process because I think that solitude of being with the work and not having an outside influence too soon is really important to me, to be able to tumble it around and kick it, and pull it apart and put it back together—</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: On your own.</p>
<p>EB: On my own. It’s important to me. I enjoy that process. I don’t want that taken away from and I don’t want someone else’s imprint on it too soon. I need the shape to be a little more firm. A writing community is really important to me, but not poem-by-poem. The sense that there are other people out there engaged in the work is almost one of the most important things.</p>
<p>And then there’s this other excitement that happens like when you’re at a conference like AWP, the ASLE conference, Bread Loaf, or Sewanee. A gathering of writers. When those people come together and there’s that energy of all those people bringing forward their concerns and starting to see trends in the conversation, whether it’s aesthetic or subject, that’s really fascinating, too. And I love to immerse in that and then run away.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: (laughs) I definitely felt like that after AWP this year.</p>
<p>EB: Oh, it’s overwhelming, right? The running away is important, too.</p>

	<div class="entrycontent section pad20">
<p>Some links with a bit of heft to keep you through the summer.  by Tony Quick</p>
<p>“<a title="The Outer Reaches of Love" href="http://www.barrelhousemag.com/the-outer-reaches-of-love-by-jp-kemmick/" target="_blank">The Outer Reaches of Love</a>” by JP Kemmick (from <em>Barrelhouse</em>)</p>
<p>Long distance relationships are difficult but what can you do when your wife is an astronaut on a joint American-German research mission and your husband is a superhero? Will they remain faithful? Kemmick’s daringly original short story is a mash-up of the mundane marriage and the fantastic phenomenon of space and super-heroism.</p>
<p>“She’s thinking back to how he tried to tell her what it was like up here, the peace of the infinite, that feeling you get watching the sun rise and set, rise and set; how you worry that the Earth is aging incredibly fast without you and the ridiculous sci-fi fear that you might return to a different era, that everyone will have aged innumerable years without you.”</p>
<p>A definite must read from a writer who is clearly just getting started.</p>
<p>“<a title="The Ghost of Berries" href="http://bostonreview.net/BR38.2/joe_fassler_fiction.php" target="_blank">The Ghost of Berries</a>” by Joe Fassler (from <em>Boston Review</em>)</p>
<p>Lately, my own attempt to write the Great American Famine novel has got me thinking about the luxuries we take for granted. Year-round strawberries, food delivered straight to your doorstep. Fassler’s clearly in the same mode of thought. In his melancholy piece “The Ghost of Berries” a young man goes on a mission to find fruit for his dying mother in a world where there’s little food—let alone produce.</p>
<p>“‘Go out there,’ she croaked. ‘Find me something. Real fruit. An orange. But I’d take an apple. I’d take a single grape. Oh,’ she said, and gave a long, unholy groan, ‘I want to taste real fruit again before I die. I don’t care what you have to do—just get it.</p>
<p>He dabbed the wet rag at her forehead and whispered hushing sounds. But when he finally left the house to pace the open air by the sulfur pits, sucking the pebble he used to stem his cravings, a stuck sob widened in his throat.”</p>
<p>This sparse piece tugs at that muscle in your ribcage and the end packs a guilt-laced punch.</p>
<p><a href="http://flavorwire.com/388428/red-moon-author-benjamin-percys-favorite-wolf-stories" target="_blank">Ben Percy’s Favorite Wolf Stories</a> (From <em>Flavorwire</em>)</p>
<p>Anyone that’s met me knows I’m not above name dropping. Former Iowa State University professor Benjamin Percy has written a werewolf novel <em>Red Moon</em>, a novel that crosses literary fiction and genre. In celebration of a new addition to this talented author’s oeuvre, check out Flavorwire’s profile of Percy’s five favorite wolf novels.</p>
<p><a title="On Craft" href="https://www.graywolfpress.org/blogs/craft-fiona-mccrae-first-pages" target="_blank">On Craft: Fiona McCrae on First Pages</a> (From Graywolf Press)</p>
<p>Speaking of wolves—of a different sort—the Graywolf Press website features a craft lesson from its director and publisher Fiona McCrae on making sure the first few pages of your novel keep the publishers reading.</p>
<p>“Great opening pages, however, are all unlike, and my favorite ones nearly always contain a surprise. The surprise often does not come from language that is forced and straining to impress, but can spring from quite simple phrasing, which nonetheless signals something quite dramatic. Think of Orwell’s clocks striking thirteen at the beginning of 1984, for example.”</p>
<p>The advice is solid and practical. If you’re an aspiring writer, I’d definitely recommend giving it a read.</p>
<p><a title="Contest Submissions" href="http://www.pw.org/content/the_smart_approach_to_contest_submissions" target="_blank">The Smart Approach to Contest Submissions</a> (From <em>Poets &amp; Writers</em>)</p>
<p>Many literary magazines are tied to MFA programs, so many—including Flyway—don’t take submissions during the summer. I always take this opportunity to re-evaluate my strategies and cleaning up bad habits. <em>Poets &amp; Writers</em> magazine has a great seven-point list to help aspiring writers get their manuscripts ready for their date with the editor. My favorite is number 3: Judge your judge.</p>
<p>“Read that famous poet’s work as well as the work of winners that judge has chosen in the past. Read interviews with that well-known novelist, reviews of her latest book, articles and essays she has published in magazines. Try to figure out not only how she writes but also how she thinks, how she reads. Never heard of the judge? Double your efforts and proceed with caution.”</p>
<p>Have fun reading, revising, and since you’re already here, peruse the Flyway website. We’ll be posting content during the summer. Happy reading!</p>

<p><em>TwERK</em><br />
By <a title="Latasha N. Nevada Diggs" href="http://www.latashadiggs.com/?page=home" target="_blank">Latasha N. Nevada Diggs</a></p>
<p>Belladonna Press, 2013<br />
$15 paper, ISBN 978-0-9885399-0-7</p>
<p>reviewed by Xavier Cavazos</p>
<p>Douglas Kearney’s cover design well fits Latasha N. Diggs new book of poems, <em>TwERK</em>: just as his design is composed of bright contrasting color, so too are Diggs’ poems, with multiple languages and contrasting syntax and line breaks and breath and rhythm.</p>
<p>Diggs is interested in many languages delivered as one universal tongue. She has published three chapbooks and has shared the stage with world heavyweights of song and verse and screen, and is now ready to claim her own title as poetic heavyweight. Diggs mixes Japanese with pop culture; Spanish with “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” Maori English and Samoan with “Che Fong’s Bungalow;” all with an abstract eye intertwined with a plausible narrative.</p>
<p>Truly an original voice!! And she doesn&#8217;t ignore nature and the natural world in favor of urban meditation. In the poem “My first Black Nature Poem,” Diggs celebrates the pain and ecology of the Bronx River:</p>
<p>&#8220;the Bronx River is said to be clean: we care about clean.<br />
a month before, two boys drowned in the Bronx River.<br />
a week after, a boy jumps into it unfazed.&#8221;</p>
<p>One river. One ocean. One voice. Unfazed, is what Latasha N Diggs communicates with her poems. Unfazed by the world’s hatred. Unfazed by love, by life, by animals, by relationships, by language, by fashion, by the world constructed in TwERK! Don’t be square!!</p>
<p>Diggs you all!<br />

<p>Web Rove: Northern Exposures<br />
By Meg Brown</p>
<p>Popular imagination regards North Dakota and the surrounding northern plains region as sparsely-populated and culturally homogeneous “flyover country,” home to little else but wheat fields and prairie dogs. However, writers and artists who visit this country have long recognized the northern plains as a place of subtle beauty and tempered grace. Shaped by an increasing demand for energy and food, the northern plains region now plays a critical role in our nation’s economic and environmental future.</p>
<p>“<a title="The Emptied Prairie" href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/01/emptied-north-dakota/bowden-text.html" target="_blank">The Emptied Prairie</a>” by Charles Bowden and Eugene Richards (from <em>National Geographic</em>)</p>
<p>The northern plains region has been plagued for decades by “brain drain” – the outmigration of young educated people to large cities in other states, leaving a dwindling population and all-but-abandoned towns. In “The Emptied Prairie,” Charles Bowden takes us on a bleak tour of western North Dakota’s ghost towns. Don’t miss the gallery of chilling images from photographer Eugene Richards.</p>
<p>“<a title="The New Oil Landscape" href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/bakken-shale-oil/dobb-text" target="_blank">The New Oil Landscape</a>” by Edwin Dobb and Eugene Richards (from <em>National Geographic</em>)</p>
<p>When Eugene Richards returned to photograph western North Dakota in 2012, he encountered a far different story. With the advent of the technology needed to recover an estimated seven billion barrels of crude oil in the Bakken oil shale formation, North Dakota became the #2 oil-producing state, second only to Texas. Recession refugees from across the country flocked to the region by the thousands in search of oil industry jobs. Now the fastest growing state in the nation, North Dakota’s population is projected to grow 20% by 2020, and the influx has already caused housing shortages in cities as far east as Grand Forks and Fargo. Meanwhile, the use of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) brings the looming threat of pollution and permanent, catastrophic environmental damage.</p>
<p>“<a title="North Dakota's Oil Boom" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2013/03/north-dakotas-oil-boom/100473/" target="_blank">In Focus: North Dakota’s Oil Boom</a>” by Alan Taylor, Jim Urquhart, and Shannon Stapleton (from <em>The Atlantic</em>)</p>
<p>Ironically, the outmigration of young people due to “brain drain” meant that the few residents remaining in western North Dakota were people who were happy with the way things were. All but assured of the permanence of their lifestyle, they made their homes on the rural plains only to have their landscape rendered almost unrecognizable by the oil industry. It’s hard for outsiders to appreciate the enormity of the changes wrought upon the region now called “Kuwait on the prairie.” Barring a trip to visit it in person, this series of thirty photographs from <em>The Atlantic</em> might be the second-best way to witness a region in the grip of an unprecedented oil boom.</p>
<p>“<a title="The Same Cold" href="http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2012/02/19" target="_blank">The Same Cold</a>” by Stephen Dunn (from <em>The Writer’s Almanac</em>)</p>
<p>Residents of the northern plains have a saying: “Forty below keeps the riff-raff out.” Long winters and famously brutal cold define the climate of the northern plains, and certainly influence the social “climate” as well. In this poem, Stephen Dunn offers a convincing explanation for the well-documented phenomenon called “Minnesota Nice.”</p>
<p>“<a title="Indian Summer" href="http://www.americanlifeinpoetry.org/columns/233.html" target="_blank">Indian Summer</a>” by Diane Glancy (from <em>American Life in Poetry</em>)</p>
<p>The northern plains are a place of contradictions: an ever-present cycle of change coupled with a sense of retrogression and permanence. Diane Glancy, an indigenous voice and one of my favorite authors, captures these competing qualities in “Indian Summer.” She is not alone in her visualization of the prairie as “a horizon, an open sea” – at once a place of timelessness and new possibilities.</p>

<p>Eden from the Ashes<br />
A Review of Maleea Acker’s <i>Gardens Aflame: Garry Oak Meadows of BC’s South Coast</i><br />
by Stefanie Brook Trout</p>
<p>Last winter, New Star published the twenty-first book in their twenty-one-year-old “Transmontanus” series:  Maleea Acker’s <i>Gardens Aflame: Garry Oak Meadows of BC’s South Coast </i>(2012).  Like the rest of the books in the series, <i>Gardens Aflame</i> is short (97 pages), illustrated (with black and white images, mostly photographs), and focused on a unique aspect of life in British Columbia (a special ecosystem I didn’t know existed).</p>
<p>In <i>Gardens Aflame</i>, Acker raises awareness about the human role in creating the Garry oak meadows.  Acker seeks to teach readers a lesson about “how to live in the world” through a close study of the contested meadows. “This book could have been written about my lost Douglas fir and arbutus forest,” Acker writes.  “It could have been written about our urban creeks—Bowker, Millstream, Craigflower—or about the Southern Gulf Islands’ aquamarine coves and shell beaches.”  But it wasn’t.  Acker focuses on the Garry oak meadows because “it is an ideal microcosm for examining the aesthetic, ethical and economic preoccupations that have dogged our species.”  The complex historical interplay of humans and nonhuman nature makes the Garry oak meadows worthy of Acker’s close examination.</p>
<p>The First Nations created the Garry oak meadows though careful cultivation and management.  Fire was the crucial element to the genesis of this ecosystem:  “Before the arrival of Europeans, fires, both naturally occurring and set by First Nations, rolled through Garry oak meadow ecosystems at three- to five-year intervals: a process the Cowichan call ‘sweetening the ground.’”</p>
<div id="attachment_1644" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_fire.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1644" class="size-medium wp-image-1644" alt="Cowichan Garry Oak Preserve (Maleea Acker)" src="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_fire-580x435.jpg" width="580" height="435" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_fire-580x435.jpg 580w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_fire.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1644" class="wp-caption-text">Cowichan Garry Oak Preserve (Maleea Acker)</p></div>
<p>The meadows were gardens that fed human populations but also served as hosts to biodiversity.  Hundreds of plant and insect species, plus various birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians still call the meadows home, though many are now at risk thanks to the invasive Scotch broom, house sparrows, and English ivy—not to mention a host of other problems including fire suppression.  When Europeans settled the land, they removed the delicate balance that had worked for thousands of years.  Though the gardens reminded the Europeans of the pastoral English countryside, it didn’t occur to them that the gardens could be anything but pristine wilderness.</p>
<p>By now, many meadows have been lost to development, but many more were lost due to neglect, settlers not realizing the responsibility they had to cultivate and manage the land in the absence of the First Nations.  Without humans playing their role, the Garry oak meadows ecosystem could not sustain itself.  Recent restoration efforts have successfully saved some of this diminishing ecosystem.  Restoration is a complex effort, however, complicated by competing aesthetic values.  “Essentially, to think of restoration, we are forced to consider not just how it should take place, but in whose image it should be made.  As ecologist Dave Polster said […], when we restore an ecosystem we are always playing God; to move forward, we must admit this, and somehow decide to get on with the work.”  Bold gardeners like Acker have gotten on with the work and cultivated Garry oak meadows in their front yards—to the unfortunate dismay of neighbors and bylaw enforcement.  Instead of seeing the landscape as an Eden like the European settlers, many today see only weeds in the prairie grasses.</p>
<p>Acker organizes <i>Gardens Aflame</i> into six chapters, each exploring a different aspect of the Garry oak meadows’ significance.  Photographs and illustrations accompany historical quotations, Acker’s dated journal entries, and the narrative that links all of these pieces together in a patchwork meditation on a specific place at a specific point in time.</p>

<p>In the epilogue of <i>Gardens Aflame</i>, Acker addresses<i> “</i>the crux of this story: we love what is beautiful, as so many have argued.  We love what is rare and fleeting.”  Acker argues a place like the Garry oak meadows “gives us not just physical sustenance, but a sense of emotional or spiritual connection and belonging to the place we live,” and she supports this claim with experiential evidence—not just her own but that of First Nations and those European settlers who followed as well.</p>
<p>In <i>Gardens Aflame</i>, Acker explores the paradox of humans’ role in natural environments:  “Wherever humans had landed and stayed in stable, resident populations for the longest time,” like the First Nations, “fewer plants and animal species had become endangered.  This opposes the views of environmentalists who favour wilderness parks as untouchable refugia for nature.  It questions the thinking that to truly care for a place, we must leave it alone.”  Humans evolved with our natural environments, altering them without always destroying them, sometimes improving them in the ecological sense of the word.  Acker issues a call to action to her readers; she writes, “As gardeners, we must cut the branch, pull the weed, shape the look and feel of a landscape.  We must participate.”  In this way, nature takes on a democratic world.  Wildness is not something merely to be observed; humans have the power and thus the onus to create it.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in the Midwest all of my life and have never been to British Columbia; I’ve never seen a Garry oak meadow except through Acker’s words and images.  But <i>Gardens Aflame</i> is relevant to my life, as it will be to yours no matter where you live.  The book is a case study of one ecosystem, but Acker draws conclusions with implications for a global audience.  Better known for her verse, Acker brings her poet’s pen to nonfiction and shows readers a new way of nature writing, acknowledging that humans too are a product of nature.</p>
