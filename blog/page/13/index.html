	<div class="entrydate">10 Oct 2013</div>
		<br class="clear">
	</header>
	<div class="entrycontent section pad20">
<p>In this next installment of our &#8220;Meet Your <em>Flyway</em> Editors&#8221; series, we talk with Fiction Editor Tony Quick about <em>The Dead Zone</em>, the difficulties of trying to read new fiction while in grad school, and why you perhaps shouldn&#8217;t submit stories based on a Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: In a couple of sentences, share something about your background—writing related or otherwise.</p>
<p>TQ: I’m a sucker for mash-ups, amalgamations, homage, allusion, and pastiche. I haven’t decided whether this is a strongpoint or a weakness. This is across the spectrum of entertainment—television, music, film and fiction. I’m always curious when authors experiment with their influences. What would a Bradbury story look like channeled through Hemingway’s clipped, succinct style? What would a mash-up between Amy Hempel and Haruki Murakami look like? I think letting one’s influences run wild in a work, when it isn’t derivative, has the potential to create a whole—if not better—then at least as interesting as the sum of its parts.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What book(s) can you not stop talking about?</p>
<p>TQ: I’m a huge fan of Jonathan Lethem’s <em>Chronic City</em>, James Baldwin’s <em>Another Country</em>, and John Irving’s <em>A Prayer For Owen Meany</em>. Those are definitely worth a read and if you don’t have them in the library yet, definitely put them on your list. And how could I forget? Stephen King’s <em>The Dead Zone</em> is also a highly underrated novel and the first I’d recommend to anyone that has doubts about the man’s skills on the keyboard (whoever that might be).</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What book(s) inspires or compels you writing?</p>
<p>TQ: When I’m writing short fiction, I aim for the accessibility and wit of T.C. Boyle, the descriptive imagery of Tobias Wolff, and the unexpected metaphors of Richard Bausch. It’s a bit different for my novel length stuff. I’ve always thought it would be cool to write a science fiction novel in the vein of James Baldwin’s bohemian book <em>Another Country</em>. Jonathan Lethem’s <em>Motherless Brooklyn</em> hits the right pitch when it comes to showcasing an immersive environment that serves its characters and the overarching story as well as it does its own function as a backdrop.</p>
<p><em id="__mceDel"><em id="__mceDel"><em id="__mceDel"><em>Flyway</em></em></em></em>: What literary magazines (other than Flyway) do you read?</p>
<p>TQ: Graduate school has seriously cramped the amount of time I have to peruse literary magazines but I still find time to read <em>The Gettysburg Review</em>, <em>Glimmer Train</em>, <em>Apex Magazine</em>, and the occasional <em>New Yorker</em> story.  <a title="Longform" href="http://longform.org/fiction" target="_blank">Longform.org</a> also has a great amalgamation of short stories in their fiction section, curated from online journals around the web (only topped perhaps by <em>Flyway</em>’s web rove).</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What advice do you have for potential contributors of Flyway?</p>
<p>TQ: Our journal publishes high quality writing that focuses on environmental themes. During my tenure as <em>Flyway</em>’s fiction editor, the stories that will capture my attention will experiment with often unexplored environments: oceans, caves, cities, the artic, orbit, or other interesting backdrops. I’m looking for writing that challenges the idea that environmental fiction can’t leave the forest.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Is there any fiction that you won’t accept for <em>Flyway</em>?</p>
<p>TQ: I’d refer writers to a list from <em>Strange Horizons</em> magazine’s “<a title="Stories We've Seen Too Often" href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/guidelines/fiction-common.shtml" target="_blank">Stories We’ve Seen Too Often</a>”</p>

<p>In this next installment of our &#8220;Meet the Editors&#8221; series, we talk with our poetry editor Claire Kruesel about milk-crate libraries and pterodactyls (warm blooded or cold?)</p>

<p><i>Flyway</i>: In a couple of sentences, share something about your background—writing related or not.</p>
<p>CK: I created and operated a yellow milk-crate library as a kid. I taped makeshift Dewey-decimal-system identifiers to the spines of my books and &#8220;loaned&#8221; them out to my sister and parents, and—if I recall correctly—attempted to institute fines. It didn&#8217;t last, but I still LOVE libraries!</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What book can you not stop talking to people about?</p>
<p>CK: Year in and year out, since reading William Gibson&#8217;s <i>Neuromancer</i>, it&#8217;s always wiggling its way into discussions (mostly in my head, but—yes—also with others) about the intersections between psychology, technology, communication, and architecture in the future. So, basically, any chance to make it relevant, I take!</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What book inspires or compels your writing?</p>
<p>CK: The more I write, the more I realize how inescapable the experiences and ingrained aesthetics of childhood really are. A book that changed how I viewed words—and what I wanted to get out of their arrangement in books—is <i>The Crown Snatchers</i>, by F. K. Waechter and Bernd Ellert. At the time it was, for me, innovatively subversive, challenging, and rewarding—a combination of story and illustrations that were questions themselves. Though I&#8217;m not exactly creating graphic poetry, I try to channel that feeling by writing in a way that lets people figure something out about their own minds, their own emotions, their own inner workings. A more genre-relevant, current writer I&#8217;m really enjoying is Rita Dove&#8230; about a poem a day hits the spot and inspires.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What literary magazines (other than <i>Flyway</i>) do you read?</p>
<p>CK: Thanks to social media, I like skipping around via friend-recommended poems and then digging into the parent magazine. Regular reads include <i>Rattle</i>, <i>Ecotone</i>, <i>Black Warrior Review</i>, <i>Gulf Coast</i>, and <i>Diagram</i>. <i>Wag&#8217;s Revue</i> has featured some refreshing art.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</p>
<p>CK: I don&#8217;t feel I can properly answer this question with specific names—both because it changes all the time, and because I&#8217;m a connectionist, always seeking novel variations on the same good words and ideas; names I recognize and respect guide me into magazines which are publishing relatively new voices that are likely to offer similar quality, resonance, voice, or value.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: Is there an aspect of the writing life, or the writing industry, that deserves more attention than it gets?</p>
<p>CK: Book cover design does so much work to make or break a book, in my opinion. It&#8217;s so much more than a graphic art—the psychology behind a successful designer encompasses an intimate understanding of everything from industry trends to the season&#8217;s &#8220;fashionable colors.&#8221; There&#8217;s definitely rising interest in, and appreciation for, this art—and maybe it&#8217;ll be a way to preserve the physicality of books even when the pages are in some electronic tablet. Maybe we&#8217;ll wear their visual representations on our walls as art? Check out the LA Times&#8217; &#8220;<a title="Best Book Covers of the Year" href="http://www.latimes.com/features/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-the-best-book-covers-of-the-year-selected-by-designers-20130626,0,1404191.photogallery" target="_blank">Best Book Covers of the Year.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What advice do you have for potential-contributors of Flyway?</p>
<p>CK: I want to be surprised; I want to be delighted. I want to wake up thinking about how the parallels you drew—the metaphors you implied—were as obvious, as genius, as concrete, but so completely original that jealousy and reverence are the only possible reactions. Do the work to incite an epiphany between my own neurons, tricking me to thinking it was my own—and leave me with a sweet but intrigued taste in my mouth. But most of all, I want your words to plant an understanding of how it feels to love the world like you do.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What extinct animal do you wish could be revived, &amp; why?</p>
<p>CK: Probably the pterodactyl (but only temporarily, for ethical don&#8217;t-mess-with-time-travel-and-evolutionary-order reasons). I&#8217;d wonder if other birds would freak out or somehow respond to it. And: if you cut it, would it bleed&#8230; warm or cold? (<a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news63081.html" target="_blank">2013 University of Adelaide research</a> indicates: warm).</p>

	<div class="entrydate">1 Oct 2013</div>

	<div class="entrycontent section pad20">
<p>By Adam Blake Wright</p>
<p>I recently suited up, smoked out bees, carved combs, and bottled 40 pounds of honey with ISU’s very own Bluff Creek Bee Club. It was easily my favorite day since moving to Iowa, and yet it made me desperately miss my hometown of Asheville, North Carolina, which is one of the country’s premiere “foodie” capitals. The city has more breweries per capita than any other place in America, and several local chefs recently received James Beard Award nominations for their outstanding culinary work. In celebration (and gentle mockery) of the honey-coated, beer-bloated, quinoa-obsessed foodie culture, here are several pieces that will tantalize the taste buds and tickle the funny bones:</p>
<p>“<a title="Surviving Whole Foods by Kelly MacLean" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kelly-maclean/surviving-whole-foods_b_3895583.html" target="_blank">Surviving Whole Foods</a>” by Kelly MacLean (<em>The Huffington Post</em>)</p>
<p>Comedian Kelly MacLean’s parody of a Whole Foods shopping experience is hilarious and relentlessly unforgiving. It quickly reminded me of the traffic gridlock that was created last week when a Trader Joe’s opened in Asheville, only two blocks from a long-standing Whole Foods. Let the upscale grocery store battle begin!</p>
<p>“<a title="The Ultimate Small Plates Tasting Menu by Kate Hahn" href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-ultimate-small-plates-tasting-menu" target="_blank">The Ultimate Small Plates Tasting Menu</a>” by Kate Hahn (<em>McSweeney’s</em>)</p>
<p>Ah, the joys of paying $27 for a bacon-wrapped grape… Kate Hahn’s fictional menu perfectly satirizes the small plate phenomenon that is a growing fixture of the culinary world. During this tasting, particles of sugar are presented under a microscope and sprayed (literally) into a guest’s open mouth. Bon appétit!</p>
<p>“<a title="Mario's Shoes by Natalie Parker-Lawrence" href="http://www.alimentumjournal.com/marios-shoes-by-natalie-parker/#.Ukn5iOuhBBI" target="_blank">Mario’s Shoes</a>” by Natalie Parker-Lawrence (<em>Alimentum</em>)</p>
<p>I love <em>Alimentum</em>, an excellent literary journal that publishes fiction, nonfiction, and poetry exclusively about food. In this piece, the author clearly has a crush on Mario Batali, the famous Croc-wearing Italian chef and current host of ABC’s The Chew. It’s a delightful read that investigates the sexual and religious undertones that permeate in our age of “food porn.”</p>

<p>In this next installment of our &#8220;Meet the Editors&#8221; series, we talk with our nonfiction editor Stefanie Brook Trout about, among other things, developing relationships with places the same way we do with people.</p>
<div id="attachment_2253" style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SBT-interview-photo-web.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253" class="size-full wp-image-2253" alt="Stefanie Brook Trout, Nonfiction Editor" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SBT-interview-photo-web.jpg" width="245" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253" class="wp-caption-text">Stefanie Brook Trout, Nonfiction Editor</p></div>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: In a couple of sentences, share something about your background—writing related or not.</p>
<p>SBT: I grew up in Michigan and, despite not having lived there for five years, still think of the Great Lakes Region as home. As much as I love going home for a week or two, however, I get a little restless after that. I believe that every place on Earth is remarkable once you get to know it, once it gets to know you, so I prefer to meet new places instead of staying where I know and love.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in Iowa for just over one year, but we are already fairly well acquainted. I call myself an Iowan and feel the need to defend Iowa to those who don’t understand. In two years, I’ll graduate from ISU and leave Iowa and try on some new place and eventually revise my self-identification, and that gives me a bittersweet kind of thrill. Iowa and I will always care about each other, but I can’t stop here, and I won’t just go home. I love the familiar, but it doesn’t satisfy my lust for learning. My only regret about life is that I can’t know all of the places.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What book can you not stop talking to people about?</p>
<p>SBT: I spend most of my social time with other writers and/or my partner, who is a graduate student in literature, so it’s more that I can’t stop talking to people about books, in general, or the book I am reading at the moment, than one single book that constantly dominates my attention.</p>
<p>But if I have to pick just one book to answer the question, I must say Richard Brautigan’s <em>Trout Fishing in America</em>, <em>The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster</em>, and <em>In Watermelon Sugar</em>. It’s not cheating because the literary sandwich (with two novellas as the bread and a poetry collection as the veggies and non-CAFO meat) is sold in one volume. If you’re unfamiliar with Brautigan’s countercultural legacy, I urge you to check out this omnibus.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What book inspires or compels your writing?</p>
<p>SBT: Whatever I’m reading at the moment. If it’s really great, it inspires me on a craft level. If it’s not what my tastes prefer, however, it compels me to actually start putting words down on the page. I sometimes get caught up in reading amazing books; my ideas can seem lame in comparison. But if I start reading something I don’t like as much, I love being able to put it down and write something that a reader like me would enjoy.</p>
<p>But the top ten authors on my obsession list are Haruki Murakami, Kurt Vonnegut, Barbara Kingsolver, Bill Bryson, E. O. Wilson, Rachel Carson, Ernest Hemingway, Rick Bass, David Sedaris, and Richard Brautigan. I’d make a spot for J. K. Rowling because I love HP, but I haven’t read her other work yet, so her place is on hold until I have more information.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Which literary magazines <span style="font-size: 13px;">(other than <em>Flyway</em>)</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">do you read?</span></p>
<p>SBT: As much as I believe in the importance of online publishing (democratizing the industry for readers, writers, and editors alike), between editing, writing, and teaching, I spend most of my time in front of my laptop. So when I read literary magazines (other than <em>Flyway</em>), I often turn to print. <em>Orion</em>, <em>Creative Nonfiction</em>, and <em>Ecotone</em> are a few of my favorite print journals. I also love <em>Crazyhorse</em> and <em>Fourth River</em>—it’s hard to choose just a few. My favorite online journals publish micro-essays and flash fiction. <em>Brevity</em>, <em>Newfound</em>, and <em>A Clean, Well-Lighted Plac</em>e to name three. Short shorts are perfect for online reading. I can’t leave out <em>Poecology</em> and <em>Terrain</em>, though. They always publish great work.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</p>
<p>SBT: I’m an emerging writer myself, so name recognition in literary magazines isn’t very important to me. Sure, it’s exciting to see a familiar name, especially if it belongs to a colleague or a professor or a favorite author, but I read print literary magazines like a book—cover to cover—and online journals like the overworked, underpaid Millennial that I am—short pieces first—regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Is there an aspect of the writing life, or the writing industry, that deserves more attention than it gets?</p>
<p>SBT: At the risk of coming off as self-important, I must say literary journals. They showcase so much talent, with emerging writers alongside the established, that too many people never see—especially non-writers. As a writer, I know how much effort and emotion goes into each submission and how hard it is to find the right place for your work. As an editor, I know how much time and thought and collaboration goes into turning a submission into a publication. And as a relative newcomer to the creative writing world, I know how unaware much of the rest of the universe is about literary journals and the wonderful work that they do.</p>
<p>I have high hopes that electronic publishing will help combat this issue. As much as I like reading print, I accept that many more people prefer to read on their laptops, tablets, and phones. Soon we might all be reading on our Google Glasses. I feel like people are reading more now than, say, twenty years ago, but they’re moving away from the book. I love the book, but I am also excited about the revival of short forms that has come with electronic publishing and the implications of that phenomenon for literary magazines.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What advice do you have for potential contributors to <em>Flyway</em>?</p>
<p>SBT: I love nature writing and travel writing, so please don’t stop sending me your best essays no matter what sub-genre they fall into, but I would like to see more variety in the types of nonfiction essays I read for Flyway.</p>
<p>Our environmental theme is to be interpreted loosely. I like a good hike in the woods as much as the next gal, but <em>Flyway</em> readers hunger for more diverse kinds of experiences. We want to read about your hometown (whether it’s urban, rural, or somewhere in between) and how it’s changed. I want to read about food and the difficult eating choices you make every day. I want to read about the time when you broke your leg and didn’t get off the couch for months and maybe that story could end with you recovering and taking a humorously unlucky hike in the woods where you’re bitten up by mosquitoes and chased by a bear. As long as it’s true.</p>
<p>The world already has a Thoreau. Write about your extraordinary life in your unique voice, and we’ll love it.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: You mentioned that you are “a relative newcomer to the creative writing world.” What world did you come from and how did you get here?</p>
<p>SBT: As an undergrad at the University of Michigan, I concentrated in history (with a focus on twentieth century world history) and the environment (with a focus on the built environment). After not finding a full-time job in any position related in any way to either of those fields, I joined Indianapolis Teaching Fellows and received my Master of Arts in Teaching (with a focus on special education) from Marian University. I taught Special Ed. for three years, two years of high school English and one of middle school science, in Indianapolis.</p>
<p>After my last graduation ceremony, my grandma jokingly asked what degree I was going to get next. I did a little research that night and discovered Iowa State University’s MFA program in Creative Writing and Environment. I hadn’t known the life I now lead existed until then. I am grateful to be where I am right now, surrounded by people who understand why I have to answer a question about “one book” with eleven authors. For once, I feel privileged to say that I have no idea where I’ll be in two years.</p>

<p>by William Bonfiglio</p>
<p>Poetry can be made accessible by the delivery of its content, and I have always valued those pieces that do not disguise themselves in complex diction or inaccessible language. After all, poetry is at its core simply another form of storytelling.</p>
<p>While researching poems to include in this web rove, therefore, I first turned to those magazines that specialize in narrative poetry, journals like the <em>Naugatuck River Review</em>, <em>Split Lip Magazine</em>, and <em>Memoir</em>. Through these and other magazines, I found poems that show exemplary craftsmanship, an emotional core, and, most importantly, a story worth reading.</p>
<p>“<a title="Fool's Sacrifice by Marly Youmans" href="http://www.the-flea.com/Issue20/FoolsSacrifice.html" target="_blank">Fool’s Sacrifice</a>” by Marly Youmans (From <em>The Flea</em>)</p>
<p>Immediately, this poem calls to mind &#8220;The Seventh Seal&#8221; and its theme of communion with death. Death is not what the protagonist of this piece expects, and this poem’s opening few lines present it not as an ironic figure, but as one that has accepted its role as a harvester. “’Originality,’” the specter says, “‘is over-prized’&#8221;</p>
<p>“<a title="On Visit to Hellshire Beach (Jamaica) by Elvis Alves" href="http://www.lowestoftchronicle.com/issues/issue15/elvisalves.html" target="_blank">On Visit to Hellshire Beach (Jamaica)</a>” by Elvis Alves (From <em>Lowestoft Chronicle</em>)</p>
<p>The scene that this piece describes is not one that we as readers can necessarily recognize, but the diction, expertly crafted, assists us here. That the poem’s greater focus regards a boy and his father, and a confession shared between the two, speaks of a greater familiar and emotional purpose.</p>
<p>“<a title="Ritual before Sleep by Amy Schulz" href="http://apt.aforementionedproductions.com/2013/02/ritual_before_sleep/#.Uj4yN2Rga2A" target="_blank">Ritual before Sleep</a>” by Amy Schulz (From <em>apt</em>)</p>
<p>This prose poem details a strangely static progression, a shedding of both clothing and emotions that the protagonist of this piece accumulated through her day. With an interspersing of small scenes of action, the reader is allowed a detailed view of a character that embraces her surrender to the monster in the closet.</p>
<p>“<a title="Coming to Terms by Katie Darby Mullins" href="http://www.sprylit.com/poetry/coming-to-terms/" target="_blank">Coming to Terms</a>” by Katie Darby Mullins (From <em>spry literary journa</em>l)</p>
<p>One idea I have been reflecting on recently is this theme of perception, of how we see each other compared to how others might see each other. This theme is examined within this piece and its narrative of a man defined by his actions and their repercussions. For the protagonist, it inspires the doubt that even this infinitely more detailed picture is also not complete.</p>
<p>“<a title="Falling in Florence" href="http://www.arroyoliteraryreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Day_falling.pdf" target="_blank">Falling in Florence</a>” by Lucille Lang Day (From a<em>rroyo Literary Review</em>)</p>
<p>This poem sets its stage: a woman dines with her husband in Florence, muses philosophically on the choices made by a fresco artist, and is suddenly debilitated. The suddenness of the break in the story, delivered in three simple words, epitomizes the shock felt by the speaker, and shows how syntax and diction can play substantial roles in a narrative piece.</p>

<p>by Claire Kruesel, Poetry Editor</p>
<p>As humidity softens, and a revived memory of winter solidifies those walls between interior and exterior, I find myself contemplating structure. We&#8217;ve ground up the ground, mixed it with water, and formed it into shapes that keep out the frostbite, or keep in a private self. Who we are under bare sky but swaddled in layers of wool, polyester fleece, or even just ideas, and who we are naked but under a ceiling, are strange inversions of the same thing. Thus I was drawn to these poems, which explore themes of structure, the material that builds it, and content in (and of) the void.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="&quot;On Metal&quot; by Jamaal May" href="https://gulfcoastmag.org/index.php?n=2&amp;si=50&amp;s=3142" target="_blank">On Metal</a>&#8221; by Jamaal May (from <i>Gulf Coast</i>)</p>
<p>&#8220;On Metal&#8221; contemplates how technology obscures mechanisms that can be intuitively understood &#8211; here, an engine. The sequestering of knowledge into increasingly esoteric arenas leaves us tempted to just let a specialist take over &#8211; but what about when they say no; when the machine stays silent?</p>
<p>&#8220;<a title="&quot;The Taking of Lead&quot; by Michael Lee" href="http://www.rattle.com/poetry/2013/07/the-taking-of-lead-by-michael-lee/" target="_blank">The Taking of Lead</a>&#8221; by Michael Lee (from <em>Rattle</em>)</p>
<p>In this four-part poem, the hand is a machine. The eye is an efficiency expert. Limitations come not inherent in structure, but in our failure to name beyond them. Like the machine-as-body in &#8220;On Metal,&#8221; in &#8220;The Taking of Lead&#8221; we see how &#8220;It seems to me this is all the body has ever wanted&#8221; &#8211; to forget its efficiency, and the naming which creates it. To live without, or beyond, language.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a title="&quot;The Sign with Nothing on it&quot; by Sarah Galvin" href="http://iopoetry.org/archives/1798" target="_blank">The Sign with Nothing on it</a>&#8221; and &#8220;Aubade&#8221; by Sarah Galvin (from <em>iO</em>)</p>
<p>These two poems speak on content, on void.  In &#8220;The Sign with Nothing on it,&#8221; literal absence presents as a prominent theme, while scent as a ghost &#8211; off the husk of a body whose purpose, foggy to a child, is obscured &#8211; fills in the rest with meaning.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Aubade,&#8221; more ghosts &#8211; of imagined memory, and of sound. I love the love of space captured in these lines: &#8220;I&#8217;ll shove my sleeping bag into a newspaper box, / and drag the box into a parking garage, / so I can live in both at once. / I refuse to interact with a structure any other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<a title="&quot;We are Both Sure to Die&quot; by Wendy Xu" href="http://thediagram.com/12_4/xu.html" target="_blank">We are Both Sure to Die</a>&#8221; (1st of two) by Wendy Xu (from <em>DIAGRAM</em>)</p>
<p>Wendy Xu&#8217;s poems easily deflect attempts at summary, but her fragmented-yet-cohesive style captures perfectly the chimeric synthesis of modern environment &#8211; both literal and psychological. In this poem, &#8220;Clutching a tiny molten piece / of someone else&#8217;s life&#8221; evolves through oxymoron and ultimatum into claiming vs. denying the body; denying vs. claiming death.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.pankmagazine.com/at-the-learning-annex/" target="_blank">At the Learning Annex</a>&#8221; by Jim Redmond (from <em>PANK</em>)</p>
<p>This last poem silvers the formal against the informal &#8211; textbook against the raw &#8211; into the real business of cutting down, with &#8220;a silver tongue / &#8230; anything / that will give up the solid.&#8221; Here, a reprisal (from the second poem) of war &#8211; this time the reasoning is a forgetting, too: a deconstruction forward, rather than back.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><strong>A Conversation with Sherwin Bitsui</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><i style="font-size: 13px;"></i>Friday, March 29<sup>th</sup>, 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">9th Annual Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness &amp; the Environmental Imagination: The Future of Water</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Sherwin Bitsui </b>is<i><b> </b></i>from White Cone, Arizona, on the Navajo Reservation. He currently lives in New Mexico. He is Dine of the Todich’ii’nii (Bitter Water Clan), born from the Tl’izlani (Many Goats Clan). He holds a BA from the University of Arizona and an AFA in Creative Writing from the Institute of American Indian Arts. Recent honors include: 2011 Native Arts &amp; Culture Foundation Arts Fellowship, 2011 Lannan Foundation Literary Fellowship, the 2010 PEN Open Book Award, an American Book Award, and a Whiting Award. He is the author of <i>Shapeshift</i> (University of Arizona Press, 2003) and <i>Flood Song</i> (Copper Canyon Press, 2009).</p>
<p>When Sherwin Bitsui came to Iowa State to speak at our Annual Wildness Symposium, <em>Flyway</em>&#8216;s Managing Editor Michelle Donahue had the opportunity to talk with him about his poetry.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>There are so many things I find fascinating about both <i>Shapeshift </i>and <i>Flood Song</i> but I think what was most intriguing was its form and length. In <i>Shapeshift </i>you have these tiny, short poems,while <i>Flood Song</i> is a book-length poem. What made you want to write a book-length poem? What sorts of decisions were involved there? And how was it different writing a book-length poem as opposed to individual poems?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Well, <i>Shapeshift</i> was my first book, so I entered with short pieces and I entered poetry in that way. There is a longer poem in <i>Shapeshift</i> called “The Northern Sun,” which is rather expansive, but it sticks to a three-page, prose-poem format. But then I also realized that I was writing in sections. I was writing shorter poems, but in sections. For some reason that seemed a little more true to my experience. I looked at my poetry and realized that somehow the white space or the negative space also informed the poem. And there needed to be silence between the pieces, so in <i>Shapeshift</i> there was that tendency to number a section, but it was still somehow contained within the poem. With <i>Flood Song</i> it seemed like the poem wanted to be expansive and it wanted to flood the horizon or the valley in which it was written. So the shape of <i>Flood Song</i> is really the shape of the flood. And it’s not a linear shape, it does move in many directions but the gravitational pull of the earth definitely is a direction in which the flood moves towards. In <i>Flood Song</i> there is movement but it is created by the world around it. The world created the reality that I’m in. I just had to follow it.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: So that flooding motion, is that why you chose to format it the way you did? The book has slightly wider pages and you space the passages of the poem very sparsely on the page sometimes. Is that feeding into that flooding movement? What made you decide that that was the right form for the poem?</p>
<p>Bitsui: There were moments where there was compression in the work and this adds to the musicality of the work. Sometimes a poem is so loaded with images and it is so compressed that it somehow blurs in the mind. I was interested in this idea of blurring and smearing because I’m also a visual artist. So I enacted that as a part of my process. Could I create this poem where I loaded the images on top of each other and they are going to collapse and on the following page they are going to be expansive again. Those came intuitively. I don’t think I did it conceptually. I think it just formed in that matter and I just followed it.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: Speaking of you being a visual artist, I noticed that you were the artist behind the cover art of <i>Flood Song</i>, which is this beautiful abstract, colorful painting that you’ve named “Drought.” So how do you think that art, “Drought” interacts with this poem, <i>Flood Song</i>?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Well, maybe they both create the same effect or feeling within the body in a way. Because I’ve been through drought, I’ve noticed my incredible longing for water. Not just for myself, but for the animals that we tended to and for the land. I was really aware of it as a young child. So the painting itself read the way that I read my poem <i>Flood Song</i>. If you noticed the smearing on the edges and its leading to something on the top right corner. Certainly I imagined that was an image of the flood. But it’s called “Drought.” Maybe “Drought” is flooding and maybe that’s the real poem. The image resonated with the intensity of <i>Flood Song.</i></p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: I wanted to talk a little about the Navajo language. I know you speak Navajo, but was it your first language? Or did you grow up speaking both Navajo and English?</p>
<p>Bitsui: It’s hard to say. I feel like Navajo is my first language. Diné Bizaad is my first language. But English was always spoken also. I think for up until I was five, Navajo was primarily spoken. Maybe I spoke a little bit of English. I don’t remember. But it wasn’t until I got to elementary school, middle school, and high school where my language really took a back seat to English; mainly when I went to school off the reservation in a public school in a border town. As a speaker of the Navajo language you didn’t speak it, because it wasn’t appreciated not just by other peers but also by the people in the education system.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: I read that you described the Navajo language as “complex and dense” and a language that brings out the sacredness in things, so how do you think growing up with this language influences the way you interact with English, primarily with your poetry?</p>
<p>Bitsui: I think speaking and being with another culture at a young age, I responded to a lot of our cultural perspectives regarding language. Navajo is very imagistic and descriptive and also very verb driven; everybody in my family spoke metaphorically about things and they spoke poetically about things. The notion of speaking and speaking well has an honorable place in the Navajo community. I saw this attention given to speakers at a very young age and I was made to speak publicly in family settings. So there was always this respect for language and craft and it fed into poetry naturally, it wasn’t ever outside of that.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: So with the title, <i>Flood Song</i> and many of the passages of it, the work reminded me of Whitman with all of his “Song of…” poems. Was that an influence you were aware of when you were writing? What poets do you think your works are influenced by? Were you actively in conversation with any poet(s)?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Not so much with <i>Flood Song</i>. In <i>Shapeshift</i> there is. There are some moments when Whitman is in conversation with me, or I’m in conversation with him. Not intentionally. I feel like I didn’t really have a floor. I couldn’t really hook it onto anything that was obvious to me. The only poet that I was in conversation with was probably my own traditional songs. Somehow I was trying to speak to the voices of before and the way they constructed their poems. It is a very voice-driven work and there is a visionary appeal to it, but there wasn’t really anyone that I could see. And I could see the long lines and the long breath reference that certain poets that have come before me use. I’m okay with that. I’m okay with those references, but the poem really grew out of this time and for whatever reason it did grow. And if there are influences, then I wasn’t trying to write “Song of Myself 2.0” or something. This poem was really born out of its time and for whatever reason, as poets we return to that form, whatever collisions occur, and then those poems emerge. I think Shermen Alexie, on the book jacket as a blurb, said he heard Whitman in these poems or he heard Ginsberg, so I won’t deny that aspect, but I don’t think I was reading them against each other when I was composing it, because the poems were written out of intuition and dreaming and trying to find a new way to speak to the present. But there still always is going to be an old way of speaking to any present. Anywhere.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: You mentioned earlier when you were writing <i>Flood Song</i> there was a sonic nature. Is that how you usually write poetry? How did you craft <i>Flood Song</i>—what steps did you go through to get it in its final state?</p>
<p>Bitsui: I wrote pieces of it and there was a balkanization of these pieces and they formed their own countenance and they broke up and they shifted with the time, whichever time I was in. Eventually I had a collection of work that didn’t belong within the short format poem structure. A lot of the reason why I built this long poem is simply because what had to be said, had to be said the way it’s going to be said. Also, even if I think about traditional Navajo songs or poems, poem-songs, they do operate in a very lengthy way. They are drawn out by the speaker who operates or recreates these poems from memory. So, the sonic quality is followed simply because it was comfortable for me to hear my poem spoken back to me. A lot of the process was giving the poems to anyone within an arms distance at some point and having them read my poem to myself. A section or maybe the whole poem. I composed it by ear. I also composed it in a way where, if the poem was in anybody’s voice, they would alter the poem with their own breath and I would listen for those nuances and I would listen for those line breaks that they were making. I would see if it worked or not. So the poem was really created by different people in a way. I wrote the words, but everybody altered the poem with their own voice at some point. Ultimately, I’m the one who created it, but I listened to how people responded to it. These were just people, not poets. Just anybody who would sit near me. I was this eccentric poet asking, “Hey, could you read this little piece for me?”</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: There’s such a sense of celebration, but also of tragic loss in <i>Flood Song</i>. For instance, you have, “where whale ribs / clasp and fasten you to a language of shifting ice” (11), an idea of moving land and losing land. You have lines that directly speak to loss, but also deal a lot with loss of sight or obstruction of sight with lines like: “I cover my eyes with electrical wires” (12), and “I bite my eyes shut between these songs” (4). How do you think loss plays out in <i>Flood Song</i>? Is it ultimately a balance between drought and flood? How did you think of loss when you were writing this? Or was that even conscious?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Probably unconscious. I don’t think I set out to write a poem about loss, it just emerged within the writing of the work. And all of those things were revealed later on. Also, I think someone once said, “All nature poetry is now elegy.” That was a recent quotation I had read, and wasn’t something I heard before writing this, but I thought it was interesting that we’re looking at nature and we’re imposing something on it that is somehow finite. It discontinues. But really it will continue and move forward. So <i>Flood Song,</i> I think is not so much about loss, but is a poem that exists in its time. And loss happens in time. But time moves past and births arrive. So there is that aspect to it; it accepts those things in a way that I personally can’t as a human being because I’m connected to things that I am connected to in a very familial way. I think I’m in a place now that even my language feels that it’s not being replanted in the voices of children. There is a kind of loss there too. But people are trying to teach the language in immersion schools, so there is hope. These things occur simultaneously. So all of that is a part of it. We’re moving so fast in all directions. I come from such a place that has been the root of my being for a millennia. How can you just move into this new world so easily? I question all of the things that are being lost. So, it’s a transitory piece and it’s a migrating piece. It’s very difficult to have to keep your foot in both worlds at the same time because you’ll be weighed down by the responsibilities that incur.</p>
<p><i>Flyway:</i> So when you wrote that wonderful line, “I map a shrinking map” is that a map of everything? Land, language, a way of life? Or did you have something more specific in your mind?</p>
<p>Bitsui: It’s probably a metaphorical map in a way. Or maybe it’s a psychic map. It’s definitely a map, maybe of language, which is shrinking. So many of our ideas are based on mapping and knowing and the taxonomy of knowing reality. Taxonomizing an experience. I really think one is shrinking and the need to map it also is the act of making it immortal and making it real for some other person to come to it and see the place that is imagined.</p>

<p>While Iowa’s temperatures are still in the nineties, the weather will soon turn, and I’ll be obliged to pack away my sundresses, sandals and short-shorts in exchange for sweaters and stocking caps. I’ll be missing those short-shorts soon enough, so I reveled in their bold scantiness and donned the skimpy scraps to rove the web for the shortest of literary short-shorts that still satisfy as much as lengthier forms. Therefore, I now declare September “Short-Shorts in Short-Shorts Month,” and I encourage you to put on your shortest of shorts (you too, gentlemen) to fully enjoy the small stories and succinct essays I’ve culled for your brief reading pleasure.</p>
<p>“<a title="Lotus by Jared Salzano" href="http://www.lightedplace.com/prizes.html" target="_blank">Lotus</a>” by Jared Salzano (from <em>A Clean, Well-Lighted Place</em>)</p>
<p>This bit of flash fiction won <em>A Clean, Well-Lighted Place</em>’s third annual summer contest, and my heart. The characters seek lotus blossoms to eat for their psychedelic powers—well, that’s an inference on my part, but it is definitely some kind of drug. This piece is so short that if I said anything else, I would give it all away.</p>
<p>“<a title="A Day in the Grammar of Disease by Sonya Huber" href="http://brevitymag.com/current-issue/a-day-in-the-grammar-of-disease/" target="_blank">A Day in the Grammar of Disease</a>” by Sonya Huber (from <em>Brevity</em>)</p>
<p>Anyone who has had chronic pain of any kind knows how it can consume your life, invade your thoughts, dictate your actions. If you haven’t suffered in this way, Sonya Huber describes the experience expertly in this brief nonfiction essay: “(10:30) Today my husband and I talked about my calcified hip and aching hands, the awkwardness of a threesome with pain.” If you have experienced pain like this, derive hope from the way Huber makes beautiful art from suffering.</p>
<p>“<a title="Planning an Atlantic Funeral by Hugh Sheehy" href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/planning-an-atlantic-funeral/" target="_blank">Planning an Atlantic Funeral</a>” by Hugh Sheehy (from <em>3:AM</em>)</p>
<p>I’ll be brief. In this lovely short-short, Hugh Sheehy waxes lyrical about promiscuous oceans, conspiring waters, and children reaching their first coast.</p>
<p>“<a title="Obvi, We're the Ladies by Anabel Graff" href="http://www.newfoundjournal.org/current-issue/reviews-lena-dunham/#.UitsCBakK0s" target="_blank">Obvi, We’re the Ladies</a>” by Anabel Graff (from <em>Newfound</em>)</p>
<p>Okay, so this isn’t a short-short, but it’s about short-shorts—Lena Dunham’s short-shorts on Girls—and it gave me the title for the Web Rove you’re reading right now. In her review of Dunham’s HBO show, Anabel Graff argues, “all writers should wear short-shorts,” and I agree.</p>
<p>Want even shorter short-shorts? Check out <a title="Trapeze" href="http://trapezemag.wordpress.com" target="_blank"><em>Trapeze</em> </a>for great Twitter-based speculative fiction. (Warning: These itty-bitty stories are so short, you might want to strip down to your underwear to get into the spirit.)</p>
