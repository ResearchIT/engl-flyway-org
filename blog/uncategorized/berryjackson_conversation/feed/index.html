					<description><![CDATA[I  want  to go  sit  on the  couch  with these  guys. Their conversation  resonated  deeply for me as a an artist and  writer who believes that  my friends  are  the  jewels in my  life, and  each  one  is unique.  &quot;My friendships have had their significance in being distinct, not in 
being alike. I don’t have much of anything to compare with this 
friendship.&quot; Beautifully  explained. ]]></description>
