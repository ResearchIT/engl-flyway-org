					<description><![CDATA[A lovely interview.  Rhett and her journal have such integrity.  And there&#039;s something quite delicious about holding Cave Wall in one&#039;s hands--the journal is spare, elegant, and beautifully produced.  It&#039;s one of the few literary journals I find myself reading in its entirety.  It&#039;s just the right size and manages to be thoroughly companionable. ]]></description>
