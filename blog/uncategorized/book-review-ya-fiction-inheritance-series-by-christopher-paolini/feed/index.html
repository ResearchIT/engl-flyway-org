					<description><![CDATA[I thought the series was great, in my opinion. I don&#039;t understand why it wasn&#039;t, at least, acclaimed (not highly acclaimed.) Sure there was flaws like Paolini doesn&#039;t write very well emotionally apart from the relationship between Saphira and Eragon which I fell in love with. His descriptions of the Alegasia are brilliant, a lot better than much older authors could describe, especially for his tender age. He has a great imagination for storytelling. But he can get off track sometimes in his story. The history of the world is intricate and Galbatorix is a compelling villain (however, he falls short of the terrifyingly evil Lord Voldemort or Lord Sauron, which I don&#039;t expect him to create but maybe in the future). The plot is... OK, at times, sometimes very good. He uses the easy way out, uses simple options to untangle knots in the story and sometimes has good twists. Exciting battles but doesn&#039;t match the heart-stopping, thrilling battles in Lord of the Rings or the final, dramatic battle to the Harry Potter series or the exhilarating action in the Hunger Games trilogy. He captivates, though, even if we are frustrated with his wandering through the world and unnecessarily long descriptions.
Considering his age... fantastic  series! &quot;A*&quot;
Being a critic... An achievement of great talent yet isn&#039;t the most original. &quot;B&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved the series and while I did agree with some of your points, like readers do not see a lot- if at all- of Eragon&#039;s emotion in the fourth book, I never did see any signs of poor editing- or any grammatical issues. The book had its own persona and was not like any other series, as you mentioned, so strongly, strongly diagree. There were many fancy, made-up names that might&#039;ve killed an English teacher, but that&#039;s what gets kids into it. Magic and cool names and lots of imagination. Overall, 4.7 out of 5 stars for Paolini. ]]></description>
