Fracture: Essays, Poems, and Stories on Fracking in America</em>.<br />
Edited by Taylor Brorby and Stefanie Brook Trout. Ice Cube Press, 2016<br />
Paperback, List Price: $24.95</p>
<p>Reviewed by: Claire Kortyna</p>
<p>In <em>Fracture: Essays, Poems, and Stories on Fracking in America</em>, editors Taylor Brorby and Stefanie Brook Trout bring together more than fifty writers to create an arresting collection of poetry and prose about one of the great environmental issues of our time: fracking. In the voices of these poets, journalists, and storytellers <em>Fracture</em> rants, raves, laments, and laughs with blackened bitterness. While all of these pieces are united in their anti-fracking stance, each piece provides a unique perspective on this complicated issue. Poised against the chasm of ignorance and misleading propaganda that surrounds fracking in America, these essays give voice to the people and the land that this industry seeks to silence. As Rick Bass writes in his essay, “The World Below,” “The earth is mysterious, the earth is alive – even as we war against it” (p. 175). This insight, among many others, opens readers’ eyes and attempts to foster an ethical, informed discussion about the disaster that continued fracking will inflict on our homeland.</p>
<p>These creative voices weave together an artful tapestry of protest and awareness through their strong lyrical prose, well-developed characters, and the stark honesty of first-hand experiences. With landscapes and settings ranging from North Dakota to Texas, this issue transcends regionalism and local geography to become a national concern. Together, these artists express an unwavering conviction that the economic benefits that fracking provides will never justify its environmental costs.</p>
<p>In “The View from 31,000 Feet: A Philosopher Looks at Fracking,” Kathleen Dean Moore takes several flights, and observes the new landscape fracking has wrought. Moore grapples with the emotional impact of this changed view and writes:</p>
<p>Let me try this: You’ve seen military cemeteries near battlefields, with closely ranked rows of crosses as far as you can see in any direction, yes? And you think my God, how is this possible, that humans could do this to one another? Now imagine that you’re in that cemetery, and it’s night, and all those crosses suddenly burst into flame – flames, flaring the methane from drilling rigs, closely ranked rows of flames as far as you can see in every direction. You think, my god, how is this possible, that humans could do this to the Earth? (p. 83)</p>
<p>Moore’s analogy reminds readers of an often-ignored truth: the destruction of our landscape spells our own. Our lives are not separate from the life of the land whose bounty we thoughtlessly plunder, always seeking the quickest fix. The essays and poems in <em>Fracture</em> are eyewitness accounts, testaments, and well-written engaging stories. The writing is stark; it resonates. Respect and love of one’s place flow underneath the collection’s hard-hitting accounts of ruined prairies and poisoned gulfs.</p>
<p>To read this book demands patience and time. Each piece requires savored consideration and weighted digestion. <em>Fracture</em> cannot, and most likely should not, be devoured. It cannot be consumed in long, sustained sittings. Instead, it should be picked up, read, and placed down, again and again, time after time. Each new piece stacks upon the others like bricks of revelation that sit heavily with the reader, percolating long after they finish the book. Claire Krüesel, in her poem “Surfacing,” writes, “The North Dakota Indian Reservations / no longer reserve much, decorous / as charred lace. / The Bakken’s fiery tongues / punctuate uncertain fields, hungry now” (p. 161). In such a substantial collection, where many essays include hefty amounts of startling research, statistics, and information, poems like Krüesel’s come as a breath of fresh air – a more imagistic rumination on the realities of this environmental blight.</p>
<p><em>Fracture</em> emerges in the tradition of other environmentally focused collections such as Terry Tempest Williams and Stephen Trimble’s <em>Testimony</em> and Rick Bass and David James Duncan’s <em>The Heart of the Monster</em>. In a sea of pro-fracking politicization, <em>Fracture</em> seeks to show readers that there is another facet to this seemingly one-sided discussion. It serves as a sounding alarm for the mute landscape fracking abuses and calls for a more responsible re-imagining of energy resources.</p>
<p>Overall, this collection fulfills an important role: it provides an essential perspective in the heated conversation about our nation’s resources in a way that fosters environmentally ethical discussion. It covers a remarkable range of material in a variety of narrative forms, and each of these renderings, for the most part, provide their own unique insights. The sheer volume of contributors however, while evidence the incredible importance of this topic, makes the collection feel dauntingly dense at times. And for those whose beloved landscapes are not echoed in these essays, maintaining an established emotional investment may be a struggle. But the essential message of this impressive book remains universal: people care about their environment – the one that fracking is harming – and it’s time for America to pay attention.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The River Won’t Hold You</em></p>
<p>by Karin Gottshall</p>
<p>The Ohio State University Press, December 2014</p>
<p>Paperback or e-book: $16.95</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Review by Camille Meyers</p>
<p>An intimate and haunting collection of poetry, <em>The River Won’t Hold You</em> by Karin Gottshall explores the human experience of loneliness and connection with others. She writes in a quiet way, folding the reader in a warm blanket of words. From “Parochial:” “Was I a person who would / one day reach forty: a question I sometimes asked / the oven. Putting on my underwear every morning / (whales harpooned for the bones against the bones / of my great-grandmother, her own soft and lonely mother).” With such precise imagery and clarity of voice, it is no wonder that Gottshall’s second book won the 2013 <em>The Journal</em> Award in Poetry from The Ohio State University Press.</p>
<p>The opening poem “Forecast” sets the theme of the collection. A “sham fortune-teller sat / turning over cards, saying <em>you will be lonely</em>—” to the speaker who thinks “loneliness / is nothing more than a cotton slip // and uncombed hair” and invites it to begin. With this boldness, and perhaps naiveté, the reader enters the first section, stepping onto a path of poems winding through childhood and growing into womanhood. Gottshall avoids slipping into nostalgia or sugar coating youth. Instead her poems reflect growing pains, such as “Lesson,”</p>
<p>that tender purchase of dart in flesh</p>
<p>allowing him to reel her bleating back</p>
<p>along a taut line of animal pain</p>
<p>she couldn’t unfasten from—at some</p>
<p>point along that axis humming casual</p>
<p>violence (and his boy heat and her blood</p>
<p>just beginning to bubble under the barb),</p>
<p>a false idea she had about this world</p>
<p>and her position in it was corrected.</p>
<p>Often, a line break leads to a surprising turn adding layers of meaning. The poem “Translation” starts: “If I were tasked with inventing a language, / I would coin a term for the feeling of being called / by a different woman’s name. There’s another word / I wish existed, for the realization that it doesn’t / matter.” With this deftness of language, she gently writes about loneliness avoiding self-pity, depression, or glorification. This theme carries on through the second section even when the speaker is surrounded by other people or in the arms of a lover. A sense of seeking companionship or an understanding of self seeps into the poems, such as “More Lies,”</p>
<p>I like a place that’s lit by lamps. I like a place</p>
<p>where you can hear people talk about small things,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>like the difference between azure and cerulean,</p>
<p>and the price of tulips. It’s going down. I watched</p>
<p>someone who could be my sister walk in, shaking the rain</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>from her hair. I thought, even now florists are filling</p>
<p>their coolers with tulips, five dollars a bundle. All over</p>
<p>the city there are sisters. Any one of them could be mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ghosts dance in the margins of the book’s third section with poems like “Ghost Story,” “Tell your phone to stop calling me,” and “Afterlife.” Hints of death pepper the entire book, but the collection ends with an acceptance of mortality and that long ago forecasted loneliness. While most of Gottshall’s poetry is narrated in first person, “Listening to the Dead” makes a small departure:</p>
<p>“<em>I’ve come unstitched</em>, says the rabbit in the orchard, belly</p>
<p>torn open by dogs. <em>Maggots have come to sew me back</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>into earth</em>. All around, the softening apples</p>
<p>drop when the wind blows and at night deer approach</p>
<p>and lower their slender necks to eat.</p>
<p>Gottshall leaves the reader with haunting imagery, like showing tenderness to a shot buck in “Operative,” or stepping into a display of taxidermy wolves renewed to life in “Diorama,” “Or you step up, / into that stage-prop forest, under the colored arch // of the long-ago sky, and walk at last into your actual life.” <em>The River Won’t Hold You</em> takes that bold step, and with a clear voice and honest eyes, walks into the reader’s life.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Review and Republishing of Todd Davis&#8217;s Poems: &#8220;Learning to Read&#8221; Vol 9.1 and &#8220;Some Heaven&#8221;Volume 8.1/8.2 Spring /Fall 2003</p>
<p>by Erin Schmiel</p>
<p>I love how easily Todd Davis expresses themes of spirituality in his quiet nature poems. He says, in &#8220;Learning to Read,”: “I understand that learning to read,/like so much of life, is about faith and doubt —/the possibility of one, the heaviness of the other.&#8221; In just three narrative stanzas we see the progression from the oblivion of the 5 year old narrator: &#8220;my joy when you told me/I was driving, too young to realize you held /the wheel&#8221;, to the responsibility of road markers: &#8220;signs /sprouted like goldenrod and Queen Anne&#8217;s lace, and you/demanded I read them, pretending not to know/what to do if I didn&#8217;t.&#8221; The final stanza carries the reader forward from this scene and out into the world knowing that what has been said is as true for them as it was for the father and son.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Some Heaven&#8221; the narrator is a father watching his child pray for &#8220;some heaven/that has no fences,&#8221; after they find a rabbit &#8220;caught between the slats of the fence,” that he has had to kill. I feel he is asking for forgiveness, too, when he believes his child&#8217;s &#8220;prayer is right/ What more should heaven be? /A place made/ of wild carrot and dill…a warm October/day that never ends.&#8221;</p>
<p>These words cut me to the quick with their urgent, yet natural spirituality. I had to pause and say —yes— this is the way of it not only for the lives in the poems, for me the reader as well.</p>
<p>Both poems are republished below with permission from the author. <span id="more-4406"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Learning to Read&#8221; by Todd Davis</p>
<p>Before seatbelt laws and airbags began to pull</p>
<p>families apart, you let me ride up front, seated</p>
<p>between your legs. My joy when you told me</p>
<p>I was steering, too young to realize you held</p>
<p>the wheel below, was incommensurate with the act.</p>
<p>But what more does a five year old wish for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the back roads of Michigan, signs sprouted</p>
<p>like goldenrod and Queens Anne&#8217;s lace, and you</p>
<p>demanded I read them, pretending not to know</p>
<p>what to do if I didn&#8217;t. The weight of your words</p>
<p>was nothing like the impress of the declarations</p>
<p>written in bold black on yellow, or the infinite space</p>
<p>white made when placed on a metal so red</p>
<p>children at slumber parties would tell stories</p>
<p>of the dead whose blood colored it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, the weight I carried came from the letters</p>
<p>whose meaning I worked hard to explicate, trying</p>
<p>to understand how they offered either absolution</p>
<p>or extinction—our very future depending upon</p>
<p>how I sounded out S-T-O-P. Knowing now</p>
<p>you would have stopped whether I could read</p>
<p>the sign or not, I understand that learning to read,</p>
<p>like so much of life, is about faith and doubt—</p>
<p>the possibility of one, the heaviness of the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some Heaven&#8221; by Todd Davis</p>
<p>The rabbit&#8217;s head is caught</p>
<p>between the slats of the fence,</p>
<p>and in its struggle it has turned</p>
<p>so now the hind legs nearly touch</p>
<p>the nose—neck broken, lungs failing.</p>
<p>My boys ask me to do something</p>
<p>but see no mercy in my plan</p>
<p>to make sure the animal is dead.</p>
<p>At four and seven, they are so far</p>
<p>away from their own deaths</p>
<p>that they cannot imagine</p>
<p>the blessing a shovel might hold,</p>
<p>nor the lesson suffering offers</p>
<p>to those who have not suffered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At bedtime, my youngest prays</p>
<p>the rabbit is in some heaven</p>
<p>where there are no fences, where</p>
<p>in death there is more than enough</p>
<p>to eat. He begins to cry, and we rock</p>
<p>until sleep&#8217;s embrace takes him</p>
<p>from me. Sitting on his bed, I know</p>
<p>his prayer is right. What more</p>
<p>should heaven be? A place made</p>
<p>of wild carrot and dill, sunflower</p>
<p>and phlox, fields the stretch on</p>
<p>for miles, every coyote full, every</p>
<p>hawk passing over, a warm October</p>
<p>day that need never end.</p>

<p>Otherness: Flyway’s Asian American Special Issue</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em> reveals the “other” in identity, cross-cultural mishaps, food, and sense of place with this special Asian American issue. From the black and white photograph of Japanese-Americans departing for WWII internment camps, on the cover, to a white woman’s confusion in her Thai boyfriend’s family in “The Whitest Woman in America,” the writings in this collection reach beyond what it means to be Asian-American. Poems and stories in this issue reveal the collectivity of human experiences, exploring what it means to be human. The following are standout pieces of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction found in this issue:</p>
<p><span id="more-4396"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>“Minidoka, Idaho, Winter 1944,” a poem by former Iowa State University professor Neil Nakadate, recalls the double-standard of being “other,” as Japanese-Americans fought for the U.S. during WWII while their families were interned at relocation camps. The final two lines capture the heart of the poem: “Gold stars shine in the desert night,/ and dust settles on the windowpanes.” Another poem, “Backflips” by Charles Valle, portrays the duality and isolation of the speaker’s experience in tightly constructed tercets: “I learned from the laughter/ Simulated in sitcoms/ Just where to touch/ People and make them forget/ Just how foreign/ My first words were.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity in this issue is taken seriously by most writers, such as Nakadate and Valle. However, some writers approach the subject with sardonic wit. In “How the Lee Family Has Fun on a Friday Night,” San Franciscan poet Priscilla Lee juxtaposes stereotypes of Chinese families with Richard Simmons exercise tapes: “<em>Is this what Chinese people</em> / <em>do for a good time on a Friday night?</em> George asks, wondering what the hell/ happened to mahjong and opium dens.” Sarah Littlecrow-Russel’s poem “My Ancestor’s Supernatural Dating Service Fails” provides a portrait of multicultural confusion and role of women in relationships. The prose piece “Deflowering the Sampaguita” by M. Evelina Galang, further explores the confusion of love in the context of a God-fearing culture: “Here is how we come to learn of Jesus, Our Savior. Here is what they tell us. First Holy Communion. Like the first time you are with the man you love — but they don’t say that part.”</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Both of the previously described pieces and many others also present individuals in conflict with their families and family values.“The Whitest Woman in America” by Katherine Riegal is another example of family and cross-cultural misunderstanding, as the protagonist tries to fit in with her boyfriend Ira’s Thai mother and sisters. Many of the scenes center around the protagonist’s lack of knowledge about the Thai language, leaving her outside of the family dynamic: “Chin tastes a strawberry and says ‘Sweet!’ her highest praise for fruit. ‘Taste like,’ she pauses, ‘I don’t know the English word.’ Ira says ‘Monkut?’ ‘Yes, yes,’ she says, but when I ask Ira what monkut is, he says it doesn’t taste anything like strawberries.”</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Place and natural imagery also dominates the issue, from reflecting on places where family came from to the places the speakers of these writings live, work and love. In the lyrical poem “Mid-Autumn Moon” by Jeffery Thomas Leong, where the speaker’s acute observations and rhythmic pacing mimics ancient Chinese and Japanese poets in his reflection on his future marriage: “Just moonlight laying itself down upon/ the newly-opened earth, absorbing crimson in layered soil, finally grounded.”</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year marks twenty years for Flyway: Journal of Writing and Environment. We&#8217;ve grown a lot in the past two decades. Beginning with founding editor Steve Pett&#8217;s inaugural edition, which featured pulitzer-prizing wining author Jane Smiley, to today&#8217;s mobile webpages featuring content from emerging writers and artists such as 2014 Notes From the Field Winner Susannah Clark and paintings from Jake Ford.</p>
<p>Over the years we transitioned from a print journal to the current on-line format. Flyway also became a journal run exclusively by graduate students of Iowa State&#8217;s Creative Writing and Environment program.</p>
<p>For the next few weeks, our blog will post reviews of past editions and special republished work to celebrate Flyway&#8217;s past and heritage.</p>
<p>We’ll also be hosting a special tribute panel to Steve Pett at this year&#8217;s Association of Writers and Writing Program&#8217;s Annual Conference (AWP) held in Minneapolis. Visit our booth, which will feature our first edition, even a signed copy, among many of special editions (Asian American, Native American and Latino editions).</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy these reviews and republished works and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>Hardback: $25</p>
<p>Reviewed by Meghann Hart</p>
<p>In late summer, the pale green honeydew becomes sweet, so sweet that many choose to enjoy its flesh in balls or canoe-like slices as a dessert. I opened <em>Honeydew</em>, not in summer, but in winter. This strange, rectangular melon was authored, not by a gardener, but by a contemporary master of the short story: Edith Pearlman. As I sat up in bed reading Pearlman’s latest gaggle of stories, all situated in the fictive Massachusetts city of Godolphin, a thick, nacreous juice began to drip from the pages and ooze down my wrists. Some might call this magic. I call it good writing. If you still don’t want to read this book, you should. Here are five reasons why:</p>
<p><span id="more-4371"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>Where Biology and Magic Meet</em></strong> You won’t see a deluge of flower petals falling from the sky in this collection. No, the corkscrews of narrative in <em>Honeydew</em> are all nakedly human ones. You will, however, be quick to spot the suprahuman peculiarities of the characters that people Pearlman’s world. Lyle, the teenage protagonist of “Wait and See,” does not perceive the world as other humans do. By sleight of DNA’s <em>mutatious</em> hand, he has inherited the capacity to see the world in many, many colors, an experience that lends daily life a multidimensionality far beyond the pale of standard human experience. When Lyle views a lemon, “he sees in the humble fruit….a tangle of hundreds of shades, ribbons of sunlight crushed into an egg.” <em>Trichromacy</em>, Pearlman calls it. In a world so overwhelmingly dominated by a dichromatic vision, how will the tender Lyle weather his unique gift?</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Witchy Women   </em></strong>In this world there exist women: your run-of-the-mill women, who work in hair salons and homeless shelters. They are the quiet ones who go about their work, say little, yet know much. People flock to these women, eager to pour their secrets into them. In form, these women are indeed women. In eye and in spirit, however, they are something else. There is something about the eyes, if you look closely, a dark and subtle gleam, like a window into outer space, or into the very bottom of a black hole. These are the women who make the world go round. Occasionally, you’ll see one bent over your yellow, mangled toenails—alternately, in Edith Pearlman’s work, they have names like Paige and Acelle—and you will see them often, if not everywhere.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Plant. </em></strong>If you read this book for no other reason, you should read it to meet and observe Plant. I don’t mean, here, to suggest that Plant is, in any way, human, but that this plant does indeed have a life and appearance all its own. As the charge of the charmingly off-kilter, Delliloesque Flaxbaum family of “Blessed Harry,” Plant flourishes in a dining room corner through steady infusions of mouthwash, fish flakes, and primrose extract. Plant is difficult to identify, as no listed genus-species pair seems to capture all that Plant is. Perhaps Plant is some rare variety of succulent, or perhaps plant has defied evolution and biology all together, and, in its agency, simply refuses to be defined by anyone.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Death Draws Closer </em></strong>For some, the lucky or not so lucky few, death happens all at once: a fall down the steps, a breaking of the neck, a quick cessation of the heart (preferably during sleep): other variations. For most, though, the real decline into death often has a clear, if not immediate, beginning. It is this steady yet inevitable decline, radiating out from an easily identifiable moment of transition towards death, that many humans fear, a phenomenon of contemporary post-industrial death that Pearlman captures well on several narrative occasions (i.e., the insidious curdling of a lover’s schlera, an individuated fall down a short flight of rather ordinary stairs).</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Sensitive Sensuality </em></strong>If you would like to read about some sex that is actually sexy, you might want to give Pearlman’s work a try. I don’t mean to say that Pearlman is some kind of master choreographer of sex, her characters glistening acrobats of the bedroom, but when sex happens (and it certainly does), the intense connectivity that exists between the characters is real. There is also a notable diversity of sex in this collection: old sex and young sex, married sex and unmarried sex, sex with power differentials, and sex without them. Perhaps Pearlman herself is suprahuman. Similar to the characters she writes about, her emotional and sensual intelligence seem to be off the charts, stunning—and particularly so when she writes about sex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To read <em>Honeydew</em> is to come away a little richer, a little better, a little smarter. In the final story, which shares the name of the book, Pearlman, through the voice of her bug-obsessed, anorexia-ridden character Emily, reveals to her audience the existence of a honeydew that doesn’t have anything in common with the melon, save its sweetness: “…Exodus describes…a fine frost on the ground with a taste like honey…it was really Coccidae excrement. Coccidae feed on the sap of plants. The sugary liquid rushes through the gut and out the anus…Nomads still eat it….It is called honeydew.”</p>

<p>Reviewed by Ana Hurtado</p>
<p><em>Kings of the F**king Sea</em> is an adventure; it is visual art, poetry, and prose. The protagonist, an unnamed American man, enlists as the new crewmember of Kings of the F**king Sea, a pirate ship, and his poems are his preferred method of communication; they are uncanny and extraordinary. Dan Boehl, the author, and Jonathan Marshall, the artist, interweaved English, French, and Latin into a curated literary phenomenon. Through text and images, <em>Kings of the F**king Sea</em> playfully analyzes the roles of pirates in our contemporary world. Aside from poetry, the scattered bits of prose across this book create context. The art portfolio found in the middle of the book acts like gallery show, visually interpreting the book’s themes. As a whole, the book acts like an ongoing reflection of the effects of popular culture and global issues, such as Spiderman films and human trafficking, on what could be interpreted as a dystopian universe. Here are five reasons why I could not put this poetry/art book down:<span id="more-4288"></span></p>
<p><strong>PIRATES WITHOUT EYEPATCHES: </strong>The<em> Kings of the F**king Sea</em> crewmembers are not traditional pirates. They are artists; they paint, they grow their hair and beards, and they blur the lines between intelligence and lunacy. While exploring the world’s oceans and fighting arch enemy ships, these pirates bond with each other, confessing secrets, sharing illusions, and comparing disillusions; these pirates become jealous of each other, maniacs free at sea, fearful creatures, destructive elements of human nature trapped between waves and salt.</p>
<p><strong>THE MONSTER MEGAMOUTH AND ITS NICKNAME:</strong><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">“RUN TO YER GRAVE”</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> “Megamouth” is one of the bits of prose scattered across </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">Kings of the F**king Sea</em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">. These fragments act like diary entries in the journal of the man who volunteered to be a contemporary pirate. This particular fragment of prose features the narrator’s understanding of the ship’s captain, Jack Spice, and Spice’s fear of mythic forces. The following excerpt summarizes the key aspect of this passage: “The Atlantic isn’t a road, and the Hudson isn’t a byway. It’s not about the surface, or road, or the journey. It’s about not getting caught in Megamouth, whose breath is the afterbirth of the ocean, the place where man is severed from god.”</span></p>
<p><strong>YOUR HEART WILL DIE: </strong>I become emotionally compromised when I read the ship’s gunner, Mitchie Gitau, and his passage, “(Gitau)Early Sunday Morning”. Mitchie Gitau is a victim of the future, a survivor of a war, suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. The crew’s newest addition, the protagonist, finds comfort in retelling the gunner’s history: “… he’ll tell me his face was scarred by a faulty grenade, which also happens to be the way he was finally freed. He’s killed a lot of people, but he won’t say this. Rather, it’s a shame he wears on him like a Venetian blind, it depends on the time of day how dark he makes it.” Wow.</p>
<p><strong>ART AS A POEM: </strong>The visual components of <em>Kings of the F**king Sea</em> do not interrupt the book’s narrative. The works of art add layers to the explored themes and foreshadow the prose and poetry ahead. The drawing “Amputated Legs”, 2010, graphite on paper, features severed human legs and feet piled on top of each other. Smudged lines delineate the legs and feet; the hues of grey and tones of orange drip from the drawing paper, mimicking the wetness of watercolor and dripping down like rain.</p>
<p><strong>MARK ROTHKO IS A PIRATE: </strong>Throughout <em>Kings of the F**king Sea</em>, Boehl alludes to important historical figures of the art world. For instance, the “Cobra Sombrero”’s captain is named Mark Rothko. Both Mark Rothko and the King’s of the F**king Sea’s first mate, Robert Motherwell, are American artists who contributed to the Color Field movement, dating back to the 1940’s through the 1950’s. J. John’s, the shipwright, could be a reference to Jasper Johns, another well-known American painter; his work during the Neo-Dada period is transforming and exceptional.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite lines:</strong> &#8220;So maybe I have to lie/ to tell the truth/ like how we don&#8217;t need treasure/ we want what treasure represents.&#8221; These lines belong to the poem “Ship(Enlisting)”; the poem explains the unnamed American man’s psyche and reflects on his decision to join the Kings of the F**king Sea pirate ship.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Duplex</em></p>
<p>by Kathryn Davis</p>
<p>Graywolf Press</p>
<p>Paperback: $16</p>
<p>Reviewed by Renee LeClaire</p>
<p>Let me just start by saying that I have no idea how this book ends. I have my theories. But the ending of <em>Duplex</em> is like waking up and realizing that the dream-logic you’ve been following all night, which seemed so solid and certain while you were in the middle of it, falls apart like handfuls of wet sand. You can go back and try to piece together the trail you thought you were following, the signs you thought pointed the way — and some of them are there. But this is not a story told neatly in chronological order, and the sentences scattered like clues throughout the book only led me to what I realize is my own perception of the narrative. Kathryn Davis has created a choose-your-own-adventure novel where everyone reads the same pages in the same order, and everyone ends up in a different place in the end.</p>
<p>So here is my advice for you, if you read <em>Duplex </em>(and you should): Trust Kathryn Davis. Also, pay attention.</p>
<p>Trying to describe the overall plot of the novel not only makes your friends think you’ve done a lot of drugs before texting them passages (as I can personally attest), but also ruins the experience. So rather than attempting any sort of linear, coherent description or interpretation, here are five of my favorite quotes (clues) from the book.<span id="more-4263"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The most important thing to remember is that a duplex&#8217;s properties are stretchable but they aren&#8217;t infinite.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the major characters in this book grew up and/or reside as adults in duplexes. At first, you get the impression that this is done to contribute to the <em>Leave It To Beaver-</em>esque 1950s sensibility of the novel. Then you think it’s a statement about dualities and dichotomies. Then you think it’s a science fiction device to talk about the properties of physics and time folding in on itself and how things can exist in two places at once or be two things in the same place. It turns out, like most of the rest of the novel, to be all of these things.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A lot of people died, Janice said. You&#8217;ve studied it in school. The world didn&#8217;t actually come to an end, but it might as well have. It was like scientists predicted. Whole countries weren&#8217;t there anymore. You&#8217;ve all seen the globe. It looked completely different.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The voice of Janice is our Sybil, our soothsayer, our liar, and through her Davis makes reference to major global changes that have occurred in the world of the novel: war and global warming and catastrophe. But she does so through a child storyteller (Janice), which makes it feel like both truth and fable. This isn’t a solid future, where we know what has happened and what the consequences were — but we know enough that it feels like our future anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If it wasn&#8217;t possible to reinvent the past in such a way as to make it conform to the present&#8217;s cheerful view of the way things ought to have been, why bother living?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The novel may take place in a post-post-apocalyptic world, where tsunamis destroyed most of the population, but we (and the robots) have rebuilt, and beehives and bassinets and baseball are back, baby. Or that might just be a story that Janice is telling the neighborhood children, like The Four Horsewomen or The Descent of the Aquanauts. Either way, Davis uses the pastimes, fashion, and mentality of the 1950s (parts of it feel like the Cleavers live next door, parts feel like we’re seeing where the mothers and children went off to in <em>Seven Year Itch</em>) to enhance the sense of what the characters <em>aren’t </em>talking about — the everything-is-fine, behind-closed-doors claustrophobia that allows our protagonists, Mary and Eddie and Walter, to follow the path(s) they do.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The thing about a life is how hard it is to make it shift course once it&#8217;s gotten going. There was no wind, no wind at all.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This book contains characters whose lives shift dramatically, and who find themselves unable to shift back. We are told early on that there will be a moment, a narrow window in which to change things, and that so much hinges on that moment. But when it comes, the change that has occurred is unclear, and you can’t help thinking to yourself, “Sure, Davis is talking about a literal moment for a single character where she has to seize the chance to maybe walk through some sort of portal into time-space, but damn if that doesn’t feel like life.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Everyone knew the meaning of a thing didn&#8217;t emerge until there&#8217;d been an ending and you could finally see how all the parts worked together.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This line comes near the end of the novel, and when I saw it I felt like Kathryn Davis was winking at me, her reader, and saying “Just hang in there, baby. It’ll all come together soon.” Well, some of it did and some of it didn’t, and most of it left me immediately wanting to read the book again to see what other parts I could find to put together and maybe make work. But the statement well represents the novel as a whole and manages to ring true, the way Janice’s stories ring true. Maybe there were floods and aquanauts and pieces of girls falling to earth like rain, and maybe they are just magnificent images that you’ll carry around with you for a week or forever. The world Davis shows us in tiny glimpses, in little windows looking out on suburban streets, is incomplete, but so vibrant you feel as if you know it anyway.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>City of Bohane</i></p>
<p>by Kevin Berry</p>
<p>Graywolf $25</p>
<p>Reviewed by Meghann Hart<i></i></p>
<p>In <i>City of Bohane</i>, the darkly brilliant first novel of Irish writer Kevin Berry, the reader is catapulted into a world of luridly shimmering debauchery, violence, and mirth. Bohane is a river city of brothels and shebeens ruled by the Fancy gang top-goon Logan Hartnett, a dapper albino, aged fifty, with a keen taste for calculated violence. For twenty-five years, ever since Logan the Long Fellow’s ascent to power and the official end of the Lost-time, Bohane has experienced an era of relative calm. However, as the year 2053 begins to cast its shadow, increasingly palpable forces, both internal and external, slink in the back alleys of Bohane, threatening to end the Calm, and with it, the ‘bino’s long rule. There’s no telling what might happen in this centuries-old Irish city, perforated to the bone by piss, blood, and bog air, but you’ll definitely want to sit your arse down and find out. Here are five reasons why:</p>
<p><b>Logan,  Macu, and the Gant: Love Triangle Divine</b> When  Logan’s old rival the Gant roles into town on the Bohane’s El train—not quite as sad as Gatsby, not nearly as regal as Odysseus—with twenty-five years of love smoldering in his heart and an intense hankering for the pre-Hartnett-Fancy past clouding up his mind like smoke from a dream pipe, you know that trouble’s about to get brewing in no fewer than a thousand dark, dank, and creviced Bohane places. Will the Gant’s appearance aggravate Logan’s old jealousies and continuing delusions of Macu’s infidelity to an intolerable fever pitch, or will Gant wander off into the Big Nothin&#8217;—the mysterious bog region that skirts the city—to wallow in the lost sweetnesses of his own sad history, alone? In the hands of Kevin Berry, King of Corkscrews, it’s hard to say.</p>
<p><b>Fucker Burke and Like Thugs </b>Names like Fucker Burke are particularly fun in that they make sentences, such as the following, literarily possible: “ ‘Like I know the fucking bogs from fuckology,’ Said Fucker.” Together, Fucker Burke and Wolfie Stanners are Logan Hartnett’s right-hand men. In their early teens, this duo lit many a hapless Bohane youth on fire. At seventeen, they have begun to realize whole new levels of viciousness, and they aren’t alone in their aspirations. Clad from head to toe in leather jumpsuits of varying shades is the beautifully malevolent Jennie Ching of the Ho Pee Ching Oh-Kay Koffee Shoppe. Berry renders these Fancy three with Tarantinoesque style, complete with lingering head-to-toe shots of cigarillo bedizened mouths, ass-kicking boots, and, of course, weapons. The young of Bohane may squabble to emulate these feral-eyed fashionistas, but only one young gangster will ascend to the Bohane throne.<span id="more-4081"></span><b></b></p>
<p><b>Darkest River of Lushest Lingo </b>So many current literary novels suffer from an extreme poverty of the surging, cut-the-mother-fucker loose kind of language that the avid reader longs for. Not so in Kevin Berry’s work. This writer has a river shooting straight out the tip of his pen. Much of <i>Bohane</i> is written in dialect that is distinctly Irish, yet other. Here’s a sample, courtesy, once more, of our friend Fucker: “If ye askin’ me,” said Fucker, “Logan H., he gone seriously fuckin’ para, like…But what’s this old Gant cunt gonna go and do on him? We got the juju over Logan, like? He’s well-protected, the Long Fella.”  This novel carries, in the crude integrity of its language, the quality that separates brilliant novels from lesser ones: spirit.<b></b></p>
<p><b>The City Itself </b> Bohane is not merely a figment of Berry’s very fecund imagination, but a culture, a map, a heartbeat—it is a place in the richest sense of that word.  In the business districts of Smoketown, Back Trace, and Newtown,“toosh” is sold, dream pipes are smoked, and meat is ground into Bohane’s favorite food: sausages.  Somewhere high above the sausage-making and whoring, amidst bluffs and clouds, loom the Northside Rises, where the “Norries” reside, seething with bitterness because the wind blows a bit too harsh in their part of town. A ways down from the Rises, to the left of the business district, stand the old, creaking manses of the Beauvista, the long-time home of Logan and other city elites. And on the margins of Bohane society, in the mysterious bog lands of the Big Nothin,’ live the “pikeys,” an old minority group of the region who loosely resemble the Roma. Among these culturally diverse districts, tensions have long been mounting. In a city so divided, who will conquer?<b></b></p>
<p><b>The Lost-time </b>According to its long-suffering inhabitants, Bohane hasn’t always been such a macabre mess. There exists a Lost-time that the old of the town speak of—a sweet time, in which the finest slices of apple pie that ever existed were pushed across bakery countertops, and black pudding was served up by the local butcher as black pudding should be served up. It is this time that draws the Gant back to Bohane after twenty-five years of exile. But there is a new era afoot in the city, an era of skin-tight leather suites and ass-kickin&#8217; stiletto boots, reminding Gant, and Logan, too, that all times—especially the good ones—must ultimately become lost. <b></b></p>
<p>My favorite lines of prose from <i>Bohane </i>are<i> </i>the first dark conjurings that make all else possible:  “Whatever’s wrong with us is coming in off that river. No argument: the taint of badness on the city’s air is a taint off that river. This is the Bohane river we’re talking about. A backwater surge, malevolent, it roars in off the Big Nothin’ wastes and the city was spawned by it and was named for it: city of Bohane.”</p>

<em>Departures</em><br />
By Philip C. Kolin</p>
<p>Negative Capability Press<br />
Mobile, Alabama<br />
Reviewed by Cathleen Chittenden Bascom</p>
<p>Peopled places are carefully wrought in the poems of <em>Departures</em> by Philip C. Kolin, Distinguished Professor at the University of Southern Mississippi. So often poems of place depict natural landscapes spared from, or void of, over-population. But in this volume, Kolin creates sacramental spaces where people are central. Kolin does paint for us un-peopled places: he lauds “Brave October on the Beach” where only gulls gather, and the soft midnight where the empress moon lingers in “Lunar equations.”<br />
The soft midnight velvet folds<br />
Into a cushion for the empress moon to linger<br />
In dalliance this first night of the solstice</p>
<p>Winnowing away her more faltering duties<br />
Of lighting the feeble and sallow-souled earth<br />
Whose breath barely sustains a season.</p>
<p>But the best poems in <em>Departures</em> carefully craft the bodies and souls of human beings in their contexts. A sacramental vision discovers spiritual reality in material form. This kind of sensibility stretches across these poems. They are not all about Southern places and peoples; we receive Chicago and Auschwitz too through the poet’s gaze. But the sacramental South is a focused subject. There are the sculpted couplets of “A Delta Christmas”; the tragic corruption of “The Slaver Superdome”; and the almost-Beat tourists’ prose poem “New Orleans, New Orleans”:<br />
They could not afford a trip to Europe. Instead, they settled<br />
on New Orleans. It had the graves, the monuments, the<br />
cuisine, the demi-denizens, the aroma of battlefields and<br />
bordellos, cobblestone poetry, the humidity of Africa…</p>
<p>Kolin portrays with concrete detail and spiritual alacrity slices of the southern United States.<br />
There is nothing saccharine-sweet in this body-soul quest. It seeks that which is transcendent in grit and grime, flesh and human frailty, and even taverns advertised by signs that blink “Yousay Beer.”<br />
Kolin’s people – often old, feeble and dying – nonetheless last. They endure. Through a fleeting glimpse of his piano teacher perched on a stool in a tavern:<br />
…one afternoon just to see<br />
How much evil lurked there.<br />
All I found was Miss Regina</p>
<p>my piano teacher who visited<br />
our apartment every Wednesday<br />
evening at seven for my private</p>
<p>lesson and stuck a silver star<br />
on my purple Scwann book.<br />
She sat on a high barstool, tall</p>
<p>Pilsner stein before her<br />
And a wingless angel<br />
Pinned to her frayed cloth coat.</p>
<p>He captures as well the unutterable spirit that animates “The Prayer Lady,” “The Secretary,” and even the twelve tribes of Israel who face “Passover in the Camps.”<br />
Well-versed and well-published on the plays of Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and Adrienne Kennedy, Kolin understands how a character is brought to life. Many of them wait in the wings for readers to encounter in the new collection <em>Departures</em>.</p>
