								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Flyway</em> would like to congratulate the winners of this year’s Sweet Corn prizes in fiction and poetry!</p>
<p>Out of a competitive field of short fiction, guest judge Daniel Wallace chose Rachel Richardson’s poignant story “What’s It Like Outside” as winner, and John Yunker’s dystopian “Free Range” as runner-up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, poetry judge Ned Balbo chose Mark Jay Brewin Jr.’s “The Weems Storm Glass Mysterious Weather Predictor” as winner and Lesley Wheeler’s “A Million Violins” as runner-up.</p>
<p>Richardson’s short story presents a multifaceted view of a high school prom disrupted by a tornado. Wallace wrote, “The writing, sentence for sentence, is smart, and sharp, and beautiful without drawing attention to just how beautiful it is. In less than a couple of thousand words the author creates a very big world, full of characters I feel like I know now. If you dropped this story in a glass of water it would expand into a novel.”</p>
<p>About “Free Range,” he wrote, “I loved the casual way the author wrote about one of our scary potential futures, and did it without being very didactic. In the end it was about what all good stories are about: what it’s like to be alive on this planet, no matter when, no matter where.”</p>
<p>Brewin’s winning poem also tells a story: About a weather prediction device used by Admiral Robert FitzRoy on his 1831 voyage to the Galapagos Islands aboard the HMS Beagle with a young Charles Darwin. Balbo wrote, “A perceptive, witty exploration of science and mysticism through a device that predicts the weather—sudden shifts not only of climate but in time&#8217;s passage and history&#8217;s whims. We are all ‘wayfarers’ who seek connection to the cosmos, and we accept guidance wherever we find it—even if what we thought was the magic of belief turns out to be only ‘seawater and cloud-smoke.’ Richly inventive and resonant.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Balbo described Wheeler’s piece as “a powerful poem that intertwines the grief of sisters facing decisions about a father&#8217;s terminal illness. Through a cell phone call that connects them across the miles—from the faraway concert one has left temporarily, to the back deck of a home where the other takes the dreaded call—the poem convincingly examines the complexity of farewells we hope to never make.”</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em> would like to thank all of this year’s entrants, a competitive field whose work explored the many facets of environmental writing.</p>
<p>Look for the winning stories and poems in the fall edition of <em>Flyway</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Deadline extended to April 20!</strong></p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>’s annual Sweet Corn contest is now open for submissions!</p>
<p>New this year, <em>Flyway</em> is accepting submissions in poetry and short fiction for the annual contest. Winners in both genres receive a $500 prize, publication in <em>Flyway</em>, and a box of organic Iowa sweet corn. Runners-up receive $50 and publication.</p>
<p>Our guest fiction judge this year is Daniel Wallace, author of five novels, including <em>Big Fish</em> (1998), which was adapted into a 2003 film directed by Tim Burton and starring Ewan McGregor. Wallace is the J. Ross MacDonald Distinguished Professor of English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he directs the Creative Writing Program.</p>
<p>Our inaugural guest poetry judge is Ned Balbo, author of three books of poetry:  <em>Galileo&#8217;s Banquet</em> (1998), which shared the Towson University Prize for Literature; <em>Lives of the Sleepers</em> (2005), which won the Ernest Sandeen Prize; and <em>The Trials of Edgar Poe and Other Poems</em> (2010), selected for the Donald Justice Prize and the 2012 Poets&#8217; Prize. Balbo taught for 24 years in Loyola University’s writing program, and is currently a visiting professor in the creative writing program at Iowa State University, <em>Flyway</em>’s base of operation.</p>
<p>The Sweet Corn prize recognizes exceptional fiction and poetry with a focus on the intersection of human experience and the environment—works that examine place, natural and built environments, landscapes and cityscapes, and the ways that people transverse them. We’re happy to read work that explores environmental issues, but also seek writing that interprets environment more broadly—the places people live and work, travel to and from, inhabit and transcend. Most of all, we’re looking for work that moves us, that gives us a fresh lens with which to view the world. Want to hear more? Read the winning essay from our 2014 Notes from the Field non-fiction contest, “<a href="http://flyway.org/nonfiction/house-blend/" target="_blank">House Blend</a>” by Susannah Clark, which examines the author’s place in a gentrifying Boston neighborhood in the wake of the Marathon bombings.</p>
<p>Submit short fiction of up to 5,000 words or up to three poems (as a single document) to the contest. Enter author’s name, bio and contact information through Submittable’s cover page; author name should not appear anywhere on the submission. Entry fee is $12. Contest closes <del>April 16</del> April 20.</p>
<p>Submit online at flyway.submittable.com, and read our latest issue at flyway.org!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The time has come for us to announce the winners, chosen by heavy-weight judge Cristina Eisenberg, of our 2014 Notes from the Field contest (drumroll, please):</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at Flyway, in the heart of Iowa under one of North America&#8217;s largest migratory bird paths, we&#8217;re in love with place! Natural places fecund with animal ecosystems, urban places bustling with man-made technology, and the landscapes of the mind — specifically, yours.</p>
<p>Flyway is calling on blog readers to take part in a new monthly round-robin photo and writing contest.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: At the beginning of each the month, we’ll put out a call for photos relating to place — the more specific, the better. We’ll collect the cream of the crop and let you, our readers, vote on the best via Flyway’s Facebook page. The winning photo will serve as a writing prompt for reader-submitted poems or fiction and non-fiction flash pieces — no more than 150 words. Again, we’ll post our favorites and let you choose the winners.</p>
<p>All new content — the initial announcement, runners-up photos, the winning photo and written responses will be posted on Fridays on the blog and Facebook/Twitter.</p>
<p>Got it? Don’t worry — we’ll post updates and reminders throughout October, our inaugural month. Just keep reading!</p>
<p>Ready and raring for this month’s prompt?</p>
<p>For our first contest we’re looking for birds, though not of the real variety. Send us photos of your favorite fake bird — rubber ducky, pink flamingo, etc — in a place you hold dear. And stay tuned for the runners-up announced on October 24th. We can’t wait to see what you come up with! Send all photos as jPEGS to eschmiel@iastate.edu.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mike Alberti is the winner of our 2014 Sweet Corn Short Fiction Contest. Our Fiction Editor Chloe Clark recently caught up with him for an email interview.</p>
<p>1.) What inspired the writing of &#8220;The Gully?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a combination of things, but I think it began with the imagery of the setting. Last year, I drove from Albuquerque, where I’m from, to Minneapolis, where I live. On the way I drove across Eastern Colorado and Nebraska and Iowa, and that was a landscape that I had never really seen before. Just the glimpse of the Great Plains that I was able to see from the window of a car was mesmerizing to me, but I realized that I didn’t have the language to think about it. I didn’t really know what a gully was, or a bluff or a headland. I couldn’t name what I was seeing, and that became the catalyst for the story: a character who has lost touch with the landscape he grew up with.</p>
<p>I also wanted to explore the connections between language, landscape, and violence. I think we sometimes tend to talk about the natural world like we own it, or control it, and that’s very dangerous. It’s also dangerous to deny our agency ⎯ I’m thinking about climate change ⎯ but to think of and talk about ourselves as masters of the earth seems both delusional and imperious: when it doesn’t rain there’s not much you can do about it. That kind of domineering attitude can be used to justify all kinds of things, and I think probably leads to alienation, not only from the natural world, but from each other, as well.</p>
<p>I actually had been writing my way around this story for a while, had done a good deal of research, and I had a lot of the material for it already ⎯ the setting, the characters ⎯ but it wasn’t coming together. Then one day, for some reason, the dog worked his way in there and after that he kind of became the still point at the center, with the rest of the story revolving around this one incident.</p>
<p>2.) This may go along with the first question, but did you grow up in a community similar to the one you depict?</p>
<p>No, I grew up in Albuquerque, though some of the places where I’ve lived have affinities with the community in the story. I’ve always been fascinated with very insular fictional settings, small contained worlds, so may of my stories seem to take place in small towns. I did do some research though, on the geography and the history of the region, especially the troubled recent economic and agricultural history, because I wanted the story to ring true to people who actually live there. But, in the end, it’s mostly imaginary.</p>
<p>3.) What is your writing process like?</p>
<p>I wish I had a good answer to this question, but I’m still figuring it out myself! It seems to change with every story. I try (and often fail) to write for a while every morning. Usually I have to start a story over several times, making slightly more progress each time, until I find a voice that can carry me all the way to the end. When I finish a first draft I like to put it away and work on other things for a while ⎯ at least a month but often more ⎯ so that I can come back to it with fresh eyes. Sometimes I abandon a story at that point, but if it still resonates when I pick it up again, then I like to do a kind of “self-workshop” where I write myself a letter about the story, as honestly as I can. After I address those criticisms in revision (which can take a long time), then it’s time to show it to people. It’s a pretty slow process.</p>
<p>4.) How long have you been writing and what got you started in writing?</p>
<p>I’ve been writing since high school, and writing “seriously” since college, though there have been some gaps. I think I must have started writing in an English class in high school, but I actually don’t remember the moment I thought, “I’m going to try this now.” I know that I have had a number of incredibly supportive teachers, without whom writing might not have morphed from hobby to passion.</p>
<p>5.) Who are some authors who have inspired you?</p>
<p>Too many to list, but the writers who I think most inspired this story are Alice Munro, David Means, Stephanie Vaughn (in particular her story “Dog Heaven,” which is just such an incredible story), Junot Diaz (especially the stories in Drown), and William Maxwell (especially So Long, See You Tomorrow, which I actually read after I had finished a draft of “The Gully” but which was helpful in revision). I also took a lot of inspiration from the poetry of Richard Hugo and Alice Notley.</p>
<p>More generally, the writers I come back to again and again include Alice Munro, Cormac McCarthy, Roberto Bolaño, and especially Virginia Woolf.</p>

<p>Mike Alberti’s story “The Gully” was chosen by judge Dean Bakopoulos as our first-place winner. Bakopoulos called this captivating story, about coming of age in Colorado, “a beautifully pensive and lyrical story that understands the complexity of nostalgia — the unbridled human capacity to pine for a place we have fled, to simultaneously love and loathe a place with an intensity that is terrifying and dark.</p>
<p>Alberti is from Albuquerque, New Mexico, and is currently working towards an MFA in Creative Writing at the University of Minnesota, where he serves as managing editor of <i>dislocate</i>, the literary magazine based at his MFA program. As our first-place winner, Alberti will receive a prize of $500 and a box full of delicious Iowa sweet corn.</p>
<p>“Going It Alone,” Laura Price Steele’s story about the choices we do and don’t, can and can’t make, is this year’s Sweet Corn runner-up. Bakopoulos was impressed with Steele’s “convincing narrative voice that is equal parts melancholic and jaded,” and he found the story’s thread, which “lingers around the hard edges of being stuck, with its adrift narrator avoiding a complicated buried truth,” especially compelling.</p>
<p>As runner-up up, Steele will receive a prize of $50. She is originally from Denver, Colorado, and her work has been published in The Oval and Moment Magazine Online. She is currently pursuing her MFA at University of North Carolina, Wilmington.</p>
<p><b>Look for these stories on Flyway’s homepage on July 15, 2014.</b></p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who submitted to our 2014 Sweet Corn Short Fiction Contest. It was a strong pool, and we at Flyway were impressed by and thankful for the good reading!</p>
<p>Finally, we’d like to offer up a special thanks to our excellent and assiduous judge, Dean Bakopoulus.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you to everyone who sent in submissions for our 2013 Notes from the Field Nonfiction Contest. We were overwhelmed by the overall quality of submissions.</p>
<p>And the winners are&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Winner:</span> </strong>&#8220;Mother I Dream of Home&#8221;  by Ah-reum Han</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Runner-up:</span> </strong>&#8220;What to Expect When You&#8217;re Expecting&#8221; by Linda Davis</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>Our winner, Ah-reum Han, will receive $500 and our runner-up, Linda Davis, will receive $50. Both winners will be published in <em>Flyway </em>and will receive a copy of our 2012 print anthology.</p>
<p>Our guest judge, Rick Bass, said &#8220;Mother I Dream of Home&#8221; was &#8220;a simple yet elegant, straightforward remembrance, touching in its sentiments and observations without being overly sentimental.&#8221; And he said &#8220;What to Expect When You&#8217;re Expecting&#8221; was &#8220;tautly drawn and tense with a fine release at the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to publishing these pieces in early 2014.  And to our readers: enjoy the anticipation of some great new nonfiction coming soon to our electronic pages.</p>
