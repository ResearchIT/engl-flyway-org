<p><em>Julian Hoffman recently gave a talk at Iowa State University on living and writing about the Prespa Lakes region of northwestern Greece. Flyway published his essay “The Memory of Land and Water” is 2010, and in 2012 his essay collection The Small Heart of Things: Being at Home in a Beckoning World won the AWP Award for Creative Nonfiction. On a sunny morning at Reiman Gardens in Ames, he took some time to answer a few questions about his writing process and his upcoming project. Follow him at julianhoffman.wordpress.com. </em></p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: You talk about being at home wherever we find ourselves, seeking home wherever we are, and yet you yourself moved from London to the Prespa Lakes region to be closer to nature. How do we embrace where we live at the moment while also keeping an eye out for the places where we truly want to make a home?</p>
<p>JH: I think our sense of home is really about our quality of connection, quality of attention to the world around us. Historically of course we have always moved, all the way back to our earliest origins in the savannahs of Africa. People spread out across the world, so movement is very much at the heart of who we are as people and as a species. At the same time I think that within movement we can embrace a sort of of everyday awareness of what is there in the slanting light and near enough to taste.</p>
<p>The bird the kestrel has this extraordinary hover in mid flight. It’s this gorgeous floating anchor in the sky, an artful and elegant hover while it hunts for food. Film studies have shown that a kestrel’s eyes move less than 6 millimeters in any direction whilst it hovers. So for each shift of the wind the bird compensates by a forward stretch of its neck or tilt of its tail. What I find really astonishing about that is that, amidst that wild beating of its wings, the kestrel is essentially still. And I wonder if that’s how we might go about sort of connecting to places in these mobile lives of ours, by trying to be still and in motion at the same moment, by focusing intently on the smallest of things around us so we can attempt to be at home wherever we happen to be.</p>
<p>And I think Sigurd Olson said that, “Awareness is becoming acquainted with environment, no matter where one happens to be.” Despite the fact that we’re constantly on the move in our lives—and that movement isn’t only physical of course, it’s often emotional. At all times we’re moving, whether it’s through memory to the past or whether it’s through imagination into the future, we’re constantly on the move in one way or another. But there are ways to anchor ourselves within that movement and I think that’s the key to trying to be at home, by tapping in and solidifying our connections to whatever place we might be at any given movement. And that doesn’t have to be some large trek into the distance, but can be as simple as a daily journey into work each morning through those windows of our commuter bus. There’re always things out there worth looking at, and well worth recording and worth connecting to. And I think it’s all these small fine particulars of our experience that ultimately mean that we’re not only at home in a physical place, but we’re hopefully at home with ourselves.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Your prose has a clarity and naturalness to it, as though it was written peacefully over tea in the early morning. What is the writing and editing process really like for you?</p>
<p>JH: Thank you, that’s very kind. Unfortunately, it’s anything other than over tea on a peaceful morning. The process for me varies. <em>The Small Heart of Things</em> was written over a number of years, for example. And some of the essays in that book emerged quite quickly out of episodic encounters. One of the essays called “Gifts,” which features a fire salamander at the heart of it, was written very quickly after that particular experience and encounter with the fire salamander. But other essays, including the one published by <em>Flyway</em> originally—“The Memory of Land and Water” which Brenna Dixon edited on behalf of the journal—that took me something like two to two-and-a-half years to write, because I struggled to find a form to try and bring these three countries that share the Prespa Lakes into a written text and convey enough of what I wanted to about this idea of the land and the water carrying the stories and history of its past in it that we can begin to observe through the tracks and signs and traces of the landscape itself. So that went through something like thirty drafts until it reached something approaching completion.</p>
<p>The process, I think, is dependent on any individual piece, and is less about the writer him or herself, than about what is necessary for the piece. And that can vary. It’s always important to be open to the needs of a piece, and try not to put too much pressure on yourself and your process, but rather try and have a sort of empathy for where that story needs to go, because I think each story has its own quite unique path, and that it’s important to try and follow that path. Of course, like any great path there are always side branches and tangents and crossroads, and sometimes you’ll be tempted down them and have to turn back, but ultimately a piece still has a kind of path that you need to kind of follow through and find your way back on to.</p>
<p>I tend to write in the mornings for the most part. But my work goes through an enormous amount of revision. And that, for me, is actually the most essential and the most joyful part of the process. I don’t find a great deal of joy in the initial putting down words. For me it’s actually the shaping and sculpting that comes afterwards that I find the real treasure chest of the whole process.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Can you talk about how your work monitoring birds influences your writing?</p>
<p>JH: Birds are such an indelible and important part of my life. They continually astonish me with their aerial grace, and they move me with their remarkable migratory journeys. But I think the thing about birds is that they’re not just these other wild sentient creatures, but I also find them to be great teachers. There’s often something about birds that teach us a great deal about ourselves and our world.</p>
<p>When we first moved to the Prespa region, I began seeing many of Europe’s most common bird species wherever I went, birds like the greenfinch, great tit, chaffinch, and the blackbird. I was finding them in these great wild forests, and these vast open meadows. I was finding them in landscapes very, very different from those of London. But it was exactly there in the city that I first came to know these exact same species. Where there’re as content to nest and feed in city parks and suburban gardens and abandoned lots as they are in a much wilder part of the Greek mountain countryside. And over time the more I saw these birds in Prespa, I began to realize that these specific species were essentially at home in the world. They’d managed to acclimatize themselves to a variety of habitats and places, and they kind of sparked the book for me in many ways. I wanted to follow this idea and look at how we might go about becoming more at home in the world. In terms of the book, the birds that feature throughout it and the birds that surround me in my life, they’re the great teachers. They set me wandering down a path that essentially asks how me might go about being more at home in the world through our daily connections and interactions.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: How do you divide your time between <em>being</em> outdoors and <em>writing </em>about the outdoors?</p>
<p>JH: Ah, that’s the golden question. It’s really, really difficult. The written text isn’t going to get anywhere near completion unless you make a considerable amount of time to sit and put those words down on paper, and craft them and shape them. But at the same time it’s deeply important to feed the well in a way, and to get out. Experiences and encounters are the source of all we do in many respects, particularly if we’re writing about the natural world.</p>
<p>So, I tend to write in the mornings, and the afternoon there’s most always my usual walk up the back valley behind our house, and then on other days there are longer walks. Having said that, I’m not absolutely strict in saying that every morning has to be given over completely to writing. Because some mornings you wake up and woodlarks are singing from the hills or there’s a glorious slant of light that comes down through these thin clouds over the mountains and it’s just too good not to go out there.</p>
<p>So, when we talk about being open to what arises around us, I think it’s also important as writers to not be so hard on ourselves that we sit down each day at the exact same time, unless that’s a practice that specifically works for you. We also have to leave room for those glorious moments that we sometimes just discover by waking up, and also the inner need to get out there and get those legs walking. Some of the best writing in my career has come actually whilst walking itself. There have been many, many writers over the centuries who have described the act of walking itself as an act of writing. And some of my best story ideas have emerged out of taking a path somewhere. So, that’s also part of the process. It’s important to try and find a balance that both gets words on paper, but also brings words into our wider world, which we absorb.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What project are you working on now?</p>
<p>JH: The book I’m currently working on is a nonfiction book, and it’s a book that’s for a long time now felt really important and necessary for me to write. It’s a book called “Irreplaceable.” It will essentially look at those places alongside those wild species that we’re increasingly loosing, primarily to development in one way or another. And these are often extremely sustaining places both for ourselves as humans but also for wild species. The book is set throughout the world, everywhere from England, to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, to Greece, and there will be a chapter devoted to the prairies of the United States, the Midwest. But what I want the book to do is tell the stories of these places. They vary in size from extraordinarily large marshy estuaries that are often protected under law, to small urban allotments and gardens which have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years and which are being sold off and have parking lots built over them.</p>
<p>It will look at ancient woodlands and it will look at sets of hills that are threatened with development. What I really want to do is tell the story of these remarkable places, often quite unsung places, through the voices of those who are out there trying to protect and preserve them each and every day. And these are the people who live in their midst and they come from a whole host of backgrounds. I’ve met teachers and soldiers and firemen and truckers. So the stories are going to be told through these voices. And I don’t want the book to be an elegy of loss, despite it being centered on loss in many ways. I really wish it to be a book of resistance, because those ultimately are the stories I’ve been uncovering. And it’s a book of love, because it’s about the deep and abiding connections between people and place that are so essential in our lives, and the connections between people and the wild denizens we share this world with. So it will bring all those things together, hopefully, in a book that celebrates place and our connections to it.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Hemmingway had to sharpen twenty pencils before sitting down to write, and Virginia Woolf could only write while standing up. Do you have any writing rituals?</p>
<p>JH: No, there isn’t actually. I’ve never really found one specific ritual. I might go through phases with certain rituals. But the only thing—and it’s not really a ritual—but the only thing that I love to see each day at my desk at the moment, which kind of gets me going in a nice way, is that just beyond our house is an abandoned home across a little field, and for the last year or so, in the eaves beneath the roof, a European Little Owl has been roosting there during the day. The little owl is the symbol of the goddess Athena in ancient Greece. And the little owl in fact still appears on the one Euro coin we have in Greece. So it’s just one of those nice symbols. And what’s funny about it is that the little owl goes away sometimes for days and sometimes weeks, and I feel like I’ve lost it. But up until now it has always returned. It’ll come back for a few days and then go off. And I have no idea where its other roost or roosts are. But it’s always wonderful to look out my window of a morning and see it there. And it closes its eyes and sleeps during the sunlit days. As the sun passes over the hills just to the west of us the sunlight glows all over its feathers, and then come dusk its eyes begin to open and it begins to stir, and as I turn out the light in our room it will make its way into the world and begin its day.</p>

Her poetry collections include </em>Science and Other Poems<em> (winner of the Walt Whitman Award from the Academy of American Poets), </em>The Monarchs: A Poem Sequence<em>, </em>Genius Loci<em>, and </em>Rope<em>. In addition to poetry, she has published four books of nonfiction: </em>Temporary Homelands<em>, </em>The Edges of the Civilized World<em> (finalist for the PEN Center West Award), </em>Writing the Sacred into the Real<em>, and her latest collection, </em>Zoologies: On Animals and the Human Spirit<em>. She received an MFA from Vermont College, a Wallace Stegner Fellowship from Stanford University, two poetry fellowships from the National Endowment of the Arts, as well as other prestigious fellowships. Her work has been awarded the Pablo Neruda Prize from </em>Nimrod<em>, a Pushcart Prize, the Gertrude B. Claytor Award from the Poetry Society of America, as well as other numerous awards. Publications such as </em>Ecotone<em>, </em>Orion<em>, </em>The Georgia Review<em>, and </em>The Norton Book of Nature Writing<em> have published and anthologized her work.  She has held residencies in places as diverse as the Mesa Refuge, Hawthornden Castle International Retreat for Writers in Scotland, and the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon. Currently, she is the Agnese Nelms Haury Professor of Environment and Social Justice in the Creative Writing Program at the University of Arizona and lives in Tucson, Arizona and Grand Manan, New Brunswick, Canada.</em></p>
<p><em>This interview was conducted at Iowa State University during the Environmental Imagination Reading Series sponsored by ISU’s MFA program in Creative Writing and Environment. It has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: To start, I’ve noticed that in your poetry collections and in <em>Zoologies</em>, you describe first encounters with the natural world and animals. What was your first profound experience with the natural world? What got you hooked into exploring the natural world in your work?</p>
<p><em>Alison Hawthorne Deming</em>: Well, this is going to be a strange answer. I think it was when I was three and a half years old, growing up in the woods in Connecticut, and I was attacked by dogs. I talk about it in the introduction to <em>Zoologies</em>. My father saved me, thankfully. I had a lot of wounds on my face that were fixed with a lot of surgeries, so I was ok. But I’ve thought a lot about that. How is it that I’m a person who loves animals and is so fascinated by animals when I could be a person who is terrified and doesn’t want anything to do with them? I think subliminally there is something in me that feels that it is a part of the animal world, a part of the animal world in a vulnerable way, which is something human beings don’t feel. We’re the top predator; we don’t always get to feel the vulnerability that all other creatures feel. So I think that was something very profound that’s hard to understand.<span id="more-4125"></span></p>
<p>Also in my childhood I had lots of books: children’s books, literature books, poetry books. And also little guidebooks: trees you want to know, wildflowers you want to know, a natural history encyclopedia. In my mind, these worlds were both the same, the story book and picture book about the natural world. Books taught you about the world, about people, about the inner life, and this marvelous, strange thing that we’re a part of. I think in my child’s mind, art and science were always one thing, not two things. I lived in a rural part of Connecticut and my parents both loved the outdoors, loved to work in the garden. So, I was outside a lot. I didn’t realize it was going to be a main subject of my work until people starting saying, “You seem to write a lot about nature,” or asking me to give readings to audiences interested in nature. Over time I realized this was an obsession that I should embrace and not worry about, because it seemed to be something I needed and wanted to explore.</p>
<p><em>F</em>: So your fascination with science, biology and ecology, does originally come from your childhood?</p>
<p><em>AHD</em>: Yes, I think it does. There were a lot of writers in my family. My parents were involved with the theatre, but my grandfather was a country doctor and amateur horticulturalist. He grew fruit trees and nut trees, and was involved with trying to save the American chestnut tree from the blight that wiped them out. I remember my grandfather and father going out, standing around these trees and talking to them like the trees were people. And thinking, “Wow, this is what men care about in the world,” and thinking that was weird.</p>
<p><em>F</em>: In your work, I noticed the amount of research you incorporated into the poems about science. It almost makes me think you had some sort of past life as an undergraduate biology major. But is that not the case?</p>
<p><em>AHD</em>: I was into biology in high school, and thought about it as a field I might go into. But I was much more strongly drawn to literature. I have a non-traditional background: I started at Brown University and I dropped out in my freshman year. I had an unplanned pregnancy; this was in the Sixties, so there was no counseling available. It was a very difficult time; I had a shot gun teenage marriage. I deferred my undergraduate education for a long time to raise my daughter, mostly by myself. It turned out to be one of my life’s greatest experiences. Talk about nature taking over and resetting the course of your life. So, no, I did not have undergraduate work in the sciences. But in those years I worked for Planned Parenthood, during President Johnson’s war on poverty. Among the programs that were set up to help disadvantaged women and families were family planning programs in rural areas. There were VISTA workers setting up those programs in rural Vermont, where I was living, and I got involved in that work. I got training in the health sciences, particularly in women’s reproductive care, and worked for Planned Parenthood for over a decade. That also tweaked my interest and capacity to think and write about science, though I haven’t written about those issues so much.</p>
<p>I never finished the B.A. degree, but I got an MFA in a low residency program and got a post-graduate fellowship at Stanford, so I felt redeemed by that. While I was at Stanford, we had our poetry workshops, but we could sit in on any other classes. There would be a conference on consciousness and I would sit in and geek out on the scientific language and exploration that was going on. That was when I began to realize the language of science had a lot of poetic potential I wanted to explore and for some reason the mechanism that makes poetry in me is excited by science. It clicked there, so I said I’m going to stick with reading the sciences and see where it goes.</p>
<p><em>F</em>: You mentioned you teach a place-based writing course, and in your poetry collections there’s a clear emphasis on place, like the poems about Prague in <em>Rope</em>. I’m curious about how travel and place has impacted your writing and the importance of it in your work.</p>
<p><em>AHD</em>: It’s been very important. As a writer, poet or essayist, you’re trying to see things anew, in a way people haven’t seen things before. Of course when you travel, you’re seeing things anew for you. There’s always an enlivening aspect to travel and heightened attention. There are also issues of appropriation and sensitivity: What can I write about without claiming too much in terms of what I know about this place? I’m concerned and sensitive to those issues. I think place is a great starting point, because if you’re really paying attention, you have to pay attention to both nature and culture in order to understand a place. This bifurcation (of nature and culture), which we know is false, begins to melt away as you explore place. That seems to me extremely fruitful. We shouldn’t think about human culture as one thing, engaged in a particular project of civilization and nature over here that we’ve left behind. We’re realizing that model is not a sustainable model and we have to understand how civilization works with nature in a way that doesn’t destroy it. Writing about place, you just have to — if you’re paying attention, engaged — to break down that binary, which seems to me a helpful thing in reassessing where we are at this time, which is a profound time.</p>
<p><em>F</em>: I see those connections in your latest book, <em>Zoologies</em>: how you make bridges between animal and human experiences in places. What compelled you to write this book? Was it a moment or a gradual urge saying “I need to write this book”? How did this project start?</p>
<p><em>AHD</em>: I read <em>Science News</em> every week, and I saw an article in there about these mammoth tusk carvings that had been made 30-40,000 years ago. They were all animal figurines: a diving water  bird, a lion-man hybrid, possibly a mammoth. And I began to think how deep the associations with animals is in the human imagination and in our art making. Most of the earliest art is all animal, in these figurines and cave paintings. I thought I’d like to explore the meaning of animals to the human imagination, from those very beginnings, through this long period of abundance of animals on Earth, to this period of the great diminishment that we’re living through now. I think that great diminishment is among the most profound things that human beings have experienced.</p>
<p>Another trigger was [that] I was teaching an undergraduate writing course and there was that slacker dude in the back row, slumped down, arms folded, not buying it. I was talking about the 6th great extinction and he’s got this sour look on his face. He puts his hand up and asks, “Why should I care about this? What does it have to do with me? I just want to get out of here and get a job.” It was one of those questions — why should you care about this? — and I realized a lot of people feel that way: “It doesn’t have to do with me, I just want to have a life and a job and have a good time” or have good work or whatever they want. I thought I could probably find 200-300 pages to address that question. Why should you care? What does it matter to us? That was another way I came to this question; what do animals mean to us now, if we really start paying attention? I didn’t want a typical book about animals that would be expected experiences; I wanted to try to find unusual experiences, like the essay about ants, a joke of rabbits on Mars, or eating oysters in a bar in L.A. It’s not your typical “I saw a mountain lion” book about the natural world, but I wanted to explore the richness of the animal presence in our lives, even at this time of the great diminishment.</p>
<p><em>F</em>: I was struck by the organization of your book. Those first essays are brutal, such as the mammoth essay and the hyena surplus killing essay. Why were those essays at the forefront before moving on to essays like “Ant Art” and “Field Notes on Hands”?</p>
<p><em>AHD</em>: Well, there are some dark ones in the middle like “The Feasting” and “The Finback Whale” which look at dark aspects of the destruction of the natural world and the feeling of grief about that. I think there’s a lot of sentimental writing about animals, pieties about how beautiful animals are to us, which they are. I think we’re at a time where some truth and reconciliation is important, to be honest. Let’s look at the whole brutal, miserable aspect. It’s not that we suddenly became violent and oblivious to the fate of animals. We’ve been this way for a long time in our history. And there are certain genetic propensities that could lead us in that direction. Like the hyenas [that] do surplus killing; they don’t care how many gazelles they kill. But if we kill a lot, we say, “This is disturbing, we don’t like it, we don’t want to be this way, why did we do it, is it possible for us to stop?” I’m interested in being honest and discerning about the long history of violence against the animal world, the fact that we now see the impact and there may be ways we can mitigate the harm we do to the world, to what remains. But you have to face how ugly and violent it has been. You can’t say, “Oh we’ve always loved animals, we love the lions.” You love the lions because they’re not in your backyard. If they were in your backyard, you would not love them. They would strengthen you, make you sharper, more intelligent and vicious if you had the risk of losing your children to those lions. There’s a viciousness in us that comes genetically because we came through a violent period in our history. We’re now at a time when our violence is not helping us survive, it’s hindering our survival. The only way we can be hopeful is to say this part of the human story we’d like to change. Can we do it? We don’t know. Who knows?</p>
<p><em>F</em>: In writing these essays, did any preconceived notions about animals change? Did any of your thoughts and feelings about the natural world shift through this project?</p>
<p><em>AHD</em>: I’m sure in many ways. One thing was [that] I did come to see [that] if I asked myself every day to look for an animal story in that day, I could find it. For a while I was thinking, “Oh I’ve never been to Africa, I have to go to Africa. Oh I’ve never done this.” I had the privilege of working in a zoo, which was great, so I got a close-up experience with elephants.</p>
<p>But I didn’t want to have only experiences you had to be a researcher or be in a privileged position to have. I wanted essays that would show on any given day you could find something. If you saw the ants in your backyard, did some research and explored that, you would have a story and it would have some resonance. In the essay about the oysters, I go to LA and I’m looking for an animal. I can’t find an animal anywhere. At the end of the day, I’m having a drink at a bar and a couple were feeding oysters to one another. I realized that when you’re eating a raw oyster, you’re eating a live animal. I thought, “There’s the animal essay!”</p>
<p>But there’s so many ways animals are in our lives that we don’t see it as an animal moment and have a sense of that kind of awareness and gratitude that animals are still giving us, in terms of food and companionship. I think I felt more keenly [how] the animal presence informed my daily life, and I wanted to keep that awareness. I always think how interesting it is, in so many different disciplines, how animals are important. There’s a lot of science in this book, but there’s also folklore, mythology, and art. Looking at the history of the dragon, for instance, every culture on earth has some dragon-like form. I learned that animals are even more broadly represented in the big human story than I might have imagined, [which] reinforced my overall assumption that this is not a peripheral relationship, but has been a central relationship for human beings since the beginning. We are animals. I feel much more connected to my animal nature and to the fact I’m a product of animal evolution. We wouldn’t be here, I wouldn’t have my life, if it weren’t for the history of animal evolution. We owe our lives to the animal world. You don’t just shoot your mother and your grandmother because you want a head on the wall. The animal world is our parentage. So I feel that much more profoundly than I did when I started. And I think other people feel it. They don’t know they feel it, but when you talk with them about it, I think they feel it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>By Ana Hurtado</b></p>
<p><b>AH: Where do you call <i>home</i>? Why? What makes this place <i>home </i>for you?</b></p>
<p>LG: I’m from Reading, Pennsylvania, like <i>Reading Railroad </i>on the Monopoly board; that’s actually where it’s from. What makes Reading <i>home</i> is not just the fact that I grew up there, but that all of my family grew up there. I identify really strongly with that area.</p>
<p><b>AH: How do you say your last name?</b></p>
<p>LG: ˈjȯr(ˌ)jē-</p>
<p><b>AH: Italian?</b></p>
<p>LG: Yes. My dad’s family actually lives in a small borough outside of Reading called Temple. It’s populated by a lot of Italians whose ancestors are all from the same area in Italy, called Ascoli Piceno. The Italian community in this area is especially small and close.</p>
<p><b>AH: What is your home place&#8217;s defining characteristic? What is unique about this place? </b></p>
<p>LG: It’s an interesting area. It’s in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, and it kind of has some of the Appalachian mountain culture, although it’s sort of at the northern end of Appalachia. The area where I grew up was, historically, mostly composed of farms. It’s also known for its Amish population; it’s the area where most of the country’s Amish originate.</p>
<p>Culturally, that makes it very distinct. The culture is referred to as “Pennsylvania German,” but if you’re actually from there, we call it “Pennsylvania Dutch.” That’s also the name of a dialect of German that’s spoken in Pennsylvania. The language is dying among the non-Amish communities, but there are elements of it in the English that we speak in that area. I grew up speaking this weird dialect of English that is, occasionally, incomprehensible to outsiders. We put our prepositional phrases in strange places and we use phrases that don’t make sense to others. I didn’t learn that until I went away to college in Boston University to study journalism; I didn’t know I used this dialect until people there pointed it out.</p>
<p>I identify really strongly with the mountains. Reading is in a confluence of different regions: farmland and Pennsylvania German culture and the mountains and former coal country. It was an interesting area to grow up, but I didn’t really know that until I moved away.</p>
<p><b>AH: What kind of writing excites you? What can&#8217;t you put down? What are you reading right now for <i>you</i>, your own aesthetic?</b></p>
<p>LG: I recently started writing poetry. I come from a journalism background, and so I’m more familiar with fiction and nonfiction. Fiction is what I was initially interested in when I came to ISU, and then nonfiction is what I’ve been writing, you know, career-wise.</p>
<p>And so I’ve been discovering a lot of contemporary poets. It’s been very exciting and rewarding.</p>
<p>In my poetry, I’ve been writing personal narratives and looking at science and the natural world; I’ve been trying to integrate this metaphorically in my poems. I’ve been getting a lot of recommendations about poetry. I just picked up <i>Life on Mars</i> by Tracy K. Smith.</p>
<p>But I tend to read whatever I come across. When people recommend things, or I read something in a blog, I tend to pick that up. I am not a directed reader; I like to have things come to me. I collect books.</p>
<p>I just picked up <i>The Blind Assassin</i> by Margaret Atwood. I was trying to describe my thesis project to a friend, and she said, “You need to read this book,” and she loaned it to me, and so that’s what I’m currently reading. And this summer I moved into a new place and the former residents left behind a lot of their books, and so I read Joan Didion’s <i>The Year of Magical Thinking</i>, which was amazing and sad. She writes about her husband’s unexpected death, and kind of chronicles the process of grieving.</p>
<p><b>AH: For readers and those submitting to <i>Flyway</i>, what advice can you give? What do you look for in the pieces you publish in <i>Flyway</i>?</b></p>
<p>LG: Looking at the art submissions, I would say that we get a lot of nature photography, and I am not as excited about that as I am about an artist who does more of a unique take on the idea of <i>environment</i> or <i>place</i> or the interaction of people in nature or in a specific environment. We recently featured an artist named Elizabeth Castaldo, for example; she did these amazing mixed media pieces – she constructed collages using fashion magazines, photographs, and interpretations of cells and trees in watercolor. They were amazing, and beautiful, and colorful.</p>
<p>So I would encourage submitters to think more broadly about the definition of <i>place </i>or <i>environment</i> and how that could be reflected in the art that they’re doing. If you’re going to be submitting nature photography, that critical bar is going to be very high.</p>
<p><b>AH: How does the idea of place or environment factor in to that?</b></p>
<p>LG: I’m really intrigued by the idea of how humans interact with the environment and the relationship between humans the natural world, between people and the places that they live. And I think that that is where some of the most exciting work I’ve seen comes into play. An artist should examine that idea and find unique interpretations of that idea.</p>
<p><b> </b><b>AH: How do you define <i>environment? </i>How is that definition important to you?</b></p>
<p>LG: I think that’s a question that lends itself more easily to some of the other genres we publish than it does to the idea of visual art. <i>Environment</i>, in the context of art, can mean ecology (traditional environmentalism, the natural world), but it can also mean <i>place, setting, </i>or<i> urban landscape</i>. In fact, we’re always excited when we receive works of art that explore urban landscapes because it always tends to be interesting; it is very different from nature photography or nature writing, which could be of a more direct interpretation of our mission. Nature photography can be something that we’re interested in, but it needs to be more than a beautiful landscape. It needs to make an argument.</p>
<p>Being part of the MFA program in Creative Writing &amp; Environment, and being part of <i>Flyway</i>, means we spend a lot of time thinking about how we can interpret environment in our own works. Because of this, I am always interested to see what other artists are doing in this same realm.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamilton-Poore: Where do you call home?</p>
<p>Clark: I call Wisconsin home. It’s where I was raised and where my family is.</p>
<p>Hamilton-Poore: What is your home place’s defining characteristic?</p>
<p>Clark: The defining characteristics of my home are probably woods and hills. Valleys and bluffs are the geographical features which most come to mind.</p>
<p>Hamilton-Poore: What kind of writing excites you? What can’t you put down?</p>
<p>Clark: I’m excited by writing that surprises or amazes me. I lean towards the speculative and the magical realist in writing. I can’t put down something where the writing, the plot, and the characters are well-done. I’m a stay-up-all-night finishing a book sort of reader. Currently I’m reading collections by Miyuki Miyabe and Emily Carroll and I’m about to dive into Emily St. John Mandel’s <i>Station Eleven</i>. Mandel is a writer of gorgeous prose and I can’t wait to read this latest novel.</p>
<p>Hamilton-Poore: For readers and those submitting to <i>Flyway</i>, what advice can you give?</p>
<p>Clark: For submitters to <i>Flyway</i>, my advice is to take risks in your writing. Also, take the “environment” in our journal title to new places: give me a haunted house story or explore a new planet. All of these can be just as much about place as any other story. Place and environment are what a writer makes them.</p>
<p>Hamilton-Poore: What do you look for in pieces you publish for <i>Flyway</i>?</p>
<p>Clark: I look for beautiful writing that also tells a really good story with interestingly complex characters. I don’t think a piece works unless if it has all three of those elements. I also look for old things done in surprising ways—show me a space exploration story that has never been done before.</p>
<p>Hamilton-Poore: How do you define “environment,” and is that definition important to you?</p>
<p>Clark: I define environment as a state of mind. Anything can be an environment if it’s well thought out: a single, unadorned room can be an environment if you make the reader feel like it is a lived-in room.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">By Meghann Hart</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i> blog editor Erin Schmiel brings to the journal an aesthetic deeply influenced by place. In an interview conducted two weeks ago, Schmiel recounted experiences of Cave Point State Park, on the Door County peninsula in Lake Michigan. Here, as a teenager, she often biked to view these limestone cliffs that hung over the water. Something about the unrestricted largeness of Lake Michigan struck her.</p>
<p>“The rocks and cliff face of Cave Point kept bringing me back,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I loved looking out over the water and dreaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>After attending Wisconsin Lutheran College in Milwaukee for two years, she decided to move to Missoula, Montana, a place she knew she could connect with both culturally and geographically. Schmiel had heard rumors of a vibrant writing community and outdoor-based culture, but what really drew her in was Montana’s promise of “big nature”—the vast, panoramic kind that there wasn&#8217;t enough of in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>“Shortly after the move,” she said, “I began work as a trail crew leader for the Montana Conservation Corps (MCC), and from May to November, I would spend ten-day stints on trails in ecosystems drastically different from those of Wisconsin. During this time, I learned that Montana’s large mountains and valleys weren’t nearly as difficult to traverse as I had originally thought.”</p>
<p>While Montana’s landscape challenged her both mentally and physically, its strong writing community nurtured her evolving aesthetic. At the University of Montana (UM), she studied under naturalist and writer Rick Bass who inculcated in her the importance of finding—and writing—the secret heart of each story.</p>
<p>“Writing the secret heart of each story is a major part of my aesthetic. It’s the glue that holds my work together and helps answer that “so-what?” question that all readers ask.”</p>
<p>While at UM, she also studied eco-criticism, an experience that helped her clarify her own understanding of environment and how this conception informed her aesthetic.</p>
<p>“I like to think about environment in terms of ecology,” she said, “this notion that everything is connected. At UM, I started to think more deeply about ecology and how it had influenced my writing through an eco-criticism course I took, in which I learned how literature informs the environment through the theories of Mikail Bakhtin and Ursula K. Le Guin. This helped me better ground my own thinking about environment in the theoretical soil of ecology and literature.”<i></i></p>
<p>Other important aesthetic influences for her include Robert Stubblefield, her mentor at UM, and Gary Snyder, Joan Didion, and <i>Harper</i><i>’s Magazine</i>—and, of course, Rick Bass.</p>
<p>“I pick up everything Rick Bass writes,” she said, “and his recent piece about the western larch, in which he discusses his love affair with this tree and why it serves as the identifying feature of a place for him, I found deeply affective—it particularly stirred me.”</p>
<p>Still, as an invested and innovative writer, she is always on the lookout for new inspiration.</p>
<p>“I’ve been told to read Marilynne Robinson because she writes about family and faith, which are two of my major joint-interests,” Schmiel said.</p>
<p>For those who wish to submit to Flyway, Schmiel shared what she hoped to see in each submission.</p>
<p>“As a blog editor, I get to publish the web roves, reviews, and interviews that I assign. I look for a lot of heart in everything I read. As long as a piece has heart, and as long I can see that the writer has really engaged with what they have written—both personally and at the level of craft—that’s what I look for.”</p>
<p>She also offered some more directive words of wisdom.</p>
<p><i> </i>“Write what you’re passionate about,” she said, “work really hard at it, and don’t give up when the writing is tough. Be persistent in your research, in your editing, and in your submitting.  One day, that most beautiful thing that you’ve always wanted to produce will emerge.”</p>
<p>In both her personal writing and work she solicits for <i>Flyway, </i>Schmiel has an aesthetic deeply influenced by place.</p>
<p>“Place is my starting point,” she said, “I use maps to see where places physically are before I begin writing about them. I’ve looked at highway 43 in Wisconsin for a short story; I’ve looked at South America and volcanic chains and plate tectonics. Maps are evocative. They help me better understand the narrative possibilities that exist for a given piece situated in a given place. I love maps, and I have to start there.”</p>

		<title>From the Rockies to Right Whales: the Aesthetic Places of Kelly Slivka</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Interview by Cathleen Chittenden Bascom</p>
<p dir="ltr">Flyway managing editor Kelly Slivka calls the open, arid landscape of the Colorado Rockies home. A rooted familiarity with the region comes through in small indicators like the absence of insects or the constant need for lotion. Slivka knows intimately the details of the mountains and canyonlands of the western United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I totally ascribe,” Slivka says, “to the idea that West is best.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet, even as a very small child, Slivka was also profoundly drawn to the ocean.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When I was just a baby, my mom took me to the ocean in Hawaii,” Slivka said. “She says she knew right then she was going to lose me to the ocean someday. And that’s what happened. I love Denver and the Rockies, but my future will be near water.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">For three years as a trained ecologist specializing in large whale biology, Slivka followed the seasonal migratory paths of humpback and right whales. From Boston to the whale calving grounds of northern Florida and Georgia, Slivka worked on a converted lobster boat doing I.D. and behavioral studies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Just as the large scale of the landscape west of the Rockies resonates with Slivka, so does the scale of the  “dark, brooding, roiling, slate-green” sea of the north Atlantic. As for Melville, for Slivka the aggressive, northern  ocean “seems to speak of some hidden soul beneath.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Certain earthscapes have that existential nature that puts us in our place. To me it’s comforting to confront our own smallness.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maybe it comes from gazing into the sky from the deck of a boat, but when asked about recent writing that impresses her, Slivka lauds Cloud Atlas, the 2004 novel by David Mitchell. She said she appreciates the caliber of the storytelling, especially the narrative complexity evident as the author weaves five or six stories together.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Flyway, Slivka seeks well-crafted, ripe pieces “that are redolent of their environment.” Even when place isn’t the point, Slivka seeks settings fully portrayed sensually, full of textures and odors as well as visual specificity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I like it when place is like a living thing.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">*-*</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">by Claire Kortyna</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adam Wright, Flyway’s Non-Fiction Editor, arrived for his interview in a flat-brimmed Tar Heels baseball hat, the symbol of his alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he studied drama and journalism. As we spoke, he rested one ankle atop his knee, seeming perfectly at ease while discussing magical realism, the role of place and environment in non-fiction, and the enduring influence of children’s book author Roald Dahl.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CK: Adam, where do you call home? And what makes it “home,” for you?</p>
<p dir="ltr">AW: Asheville, North Carolina. My family has been there many, many generations — well before the Civil War actually — and the majority of my family is still there.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CK: What is your home place&#8217;s defining characteristic?</p>
<p dir="ltr">AW: To me the mountains are a very sacred space which makes me feel both very small and very important. And that’s a connection I’ll have my whole life.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CK: What kind of writing excites you — what can&#8217;t you put down?</p>
<p dir="ltr">AW: There are two types of writing that I’m drawn to. First is magical realism, because often the words are so overwhelmingly beautiful. It reflects reality in a way that can’t be done in non-fiction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I am intrigued particularly by works of satire.  I think Kurt Vonnegut would be a great example for that, and Tom Perrotta is a more modern example. Another type of writing I really enjoy is reading children’s books and young adult lit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What I’m most excited about are works that combine the idea of magic with advocacy and a keen awareness of what the world is like in the 21st century. I recently announced a co-major in sustainable agriculture here at Iowa State University. I’m working on a young adult novel about biotechnology and food crises, which I’m very excited about because I feel like it’s a blend of my two biggest interests: writing and food.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CK: Why isn’t there environmental children’s lit?</p>
<p dir="ltr">AW: I don’t know. I’d be happy to fill that niche.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CK: Who are the children’s literature authors that have influenced you the most?</p>
<p dir="ltr">AW: Two authors that influence me the most in terms of children’s lit are C.S. Lewis and Roald Dahl. Lewis operates on a deeper philosophical level. He talks a lot about religion and society. I loved those books as a kid. Dahl, well, just because it’s so weird. Magical, silly, yet totally and completely subversive. Reading those books as an adult — it’s such a large commentary on modern society. I think he’s really trying to teach kids a valuable lesson about what it’s like to live in a modern world. That’s the type of writing I’d like to do, that’s silly and magical and yet still says something important about our world. I would say, I probably wouldn’t be a writer without either of those two.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CK: For readers and those submitting to Flyway, what advice can you give?</p>
<p dir="ltr">AW: Don’t bore me. Laughing. I feel like a lot of writers submitting to us think that having a message is all you need. You also have to be exciting. There should be an experience. It should resonate with a wide audience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CK: What do you look for in the pieces you publish in Flyway?</p>
<p dir="ltr">AW: I’m looking for things that can present science or research or commentary in a way that is original or creative  — and often that comes from the language.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CK: How does the idea of place or environment factor in to that?</p>
<p dir="ltr">AW: Well, environment and place are a key component, but it’s not just about saving the woods, or hiking or conservation. We recently published this phenomenal piece called “What Broke In the Move” by Megan Schikora which addresses issues of segregation, childhood friendships, and moving. Place and the environment are essential to the narrative, but the environment is in the social world as well as the natural one.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interview by Camille Meyers</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: Where do you call home? What makes it “home” for you?</p>
<p>SF: I have a few places I consider home: central Pennsylvania where I grew up and where my dad has a dairy farm/cheese-making operation, and Finland, where I lived for a year after high school. I consider these places home, because of the extended amount of time I’ve spent there, my connection with the land, and that these are places I come back to in my writing.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What is your home place’s defining characteristic?</p>
<p>SF: The two places I consider to be homes are quite different, and I tend to define places by their natural environments. Central Pennsylvania has rolling mountains, many diverse farms, and thick forests, so thick that people not from Pennsylvania are scared by the density of our forests. To me, it’s a funny reaction, but I see how overwhelming Pennsylvania forests can be. Where I lived in Finland was on the coast, so the sea and inland bogs defined that place for me. I was often overwhelmed by the vast expanse of water and the wind coming off the Baltic; it was so foreign to me, living by water.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What kind of writing excites you, what can&#8217;t you put down?</p>
<p>SF: The books I’ve been thinking about most lately are Margaret Atwood’s MaddAdam series, the first book <i>Oryx and Crake</i> in particular. Those books are her speculative fiction on what the future could be like based on current issues like corporate America, the food industry, and climate change. She shows how these issues can further transform American and global societies with disastrous results. Her series scares me, because I can see the events in the book actually happening. But these books also encourage me to think and act in preparation for our changing climate. What I often think of about climate change is food production and sustainable agriculture. I wonder; how will I eat? How will I grow food if the climate I knew in my childhood is different from my adult life? Though I’ve considered issues of climate change with agriculture before, <i>Oryx and Crake</i> forced me to consider the implications of our current society and food system more critically.</p>
<p><i> </i><i style="line-height: 1.5em;">Flyway</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">: What are you reading right now for YOU, your own aesthetic?</span></p>
<p>SF: I’ve recently been revisiting a poetry collection by Michael McGriff, which won the 2007 Agnes Lynch Starrett Poetry Prize, called <i>Dismantling the Hills</i>. His poems are about Coos Bay, where he grew up, and he talks about its economic downturns and describes “blue-collar” work in a lyrical way. His poems are absolutely stunning.  I’ve found his handling of rural/small town people and the harsh beauty of the Oregon coast attractive and I try to exemplify that in my own work about farming and rural life.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: How do you define “environment” and how is this definition important to you?</p>
<p>SF: This is a tough question! Environments are more than just mountain ranges or forests, but are systems of living beings. Soil is not inanimate. Shorelines are not inanimate; they are constantly shifting. I think we as humans need to have more awareness of environments as living and changing places and see that environments are also the places that we create, like cities or our own homes. We need to broaden our ideas of what environment means. It’s not just the state park 50 miles away — environment can be your own kitchen.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: For readers and those submitting to Flyway, what advice can you give?</p>
<p>SF: My advice, especially for poets, but applicable to all genres, is to read your work out loud before you submit it. This is what I do when I review submissions. It’s important that when you read out loud, the line breaks work or the pacing complements the working idea of the poem. Poetry comes from an oral tradition, and is still rooted in that tradition, even with most poems published today technically called free verse.</p>
<p>I would also suggest exploring not just natural environments, but also built environments. I get a lot of poems about trees, and trees are awesome, but I’d like to see them in a new way or place. I’d also like to see how human-made environments interact with natural environments or see as important places in their own right. I’m surprised I don’t get more poems about cities or towns, and I want to read those poems.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Place, image, rhythm, and balance are all integral to poetry. And when it comes to poetry, William Bonfiglio, one of <i>Flyway</i>’s two-prong poetry editorial team, brings a sharp eye and musicality to the table. A trained opera singer, accomplished dramatist and poet, William sat down with me for an interview last week to talk about his reading sensibility and his role as a poetry editor for <i>Flyway</i></p>
<p>“What I look for in poetry is a strong setting filled with lovely details. What we [Samantha Futhey, <i>Flyway</i>’s second poetry editor] look for is a complete piece, a story that is dependent on place, where place is a character — it should be treated as a fully-developed character. We pride ourselves on the poetry we publish, that it’s complete and polished for publication.”</p>
<p>Before entering Iowa State University, William earned his undergraduate degree at Bucknell University, where he studied with writers Paula Closson Buck and Shara McCallum.</p>
<p>“It was incredibly intimidating to be in that setting,” he said.</p>
<p>After Bucknell, William spent a gap year working the late shift at a supermarket. It’s this time that William says was his most productive writing period: he’d wake each morning and write before heading into his 2 to 9 p.m. shift. During this time William also traveled to Nova Scotia, read numerous poets and prose writers, and spent time in reflection, which solidified his conviction to pursue writing, eventually leading to his enrollment in Iowa State University’s Creative Writing and Environment program.</p>
<p>When asked about his views on environment in writing, William remarks, “When you volunteer for a journal of writing and environment, the stigma is that “environment” has to be some profound or progressive idea, when in fact, environment can be interpreted as simply as the idea of place, and the role that setting plays within inspiring stories and poetry and works of creative nonfiction. Personally, my writing has always been influenced by the place where I grew up, which spans everything from the East Coast to the home in which my parents raised me.”</p>
<p>Both Futhey and William are excited about upcoming content for <i>Flyway</i>. William describes many of the submissions to the magazine as “gifts” and says that it feels good to share these authors with the wider reading world.</p>
<p>So why serve as poetry editor? William remarks that so many writers have low self-esteem and little confidence &mdash; and that reading new material for <i>Flyway,</i> and the ability to see a wide scope of great writers, has made him more confident in his own writing.</p>
<p>“As a writer, I’m reading to better myself, to see other approaches by other writers,” he says.<i> </i>“I often ask myself what makes something memorable. I’m after that in my own writing and the writing we publish at <i>Flyway</i>.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mike Alberti is the winner of our 2014 Sweet Corn Short Fiction Contest. Our Fiction Editor Chloe Clark recently caught up with him for an email interview.</p>
<p>1.) What inspired the writing of &#8220;The Gully?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a combination of things, but I think it began with the imagery of the setting. Last year, I drove from Albuquerque, where I’m from, to Minneapolis, where I live. On the way I drove across Eastern Colorado and Nebraska and Iowa, and that was a landscape that I had never really seen before. Just the glimpse of the Great Plains that I was able to see from the window of a car was mesmerizing to me, but I realized that I didn’t have the language to think about it. I didn’t really know what a gully was, or a bluff or a headland. I couldn’t name what I was seeing, and that became the catalyst for the story: a character who has lost touch with the landscape he grew up with.</p>
<p>I also wanted to explore the connections between language, landscape, and violence. I think we sometimes tend to talk about the natural world like we own it, or control it, and that’s very dangerous. It’s also dangerous to deny our agency ⎯ I’m thinking about climate change ⎯ but to think of and talk about ourselves as masters of the earth seems both delusional and imperious: when it doesn’t rain there’s not much you can do about it. That kind of domineering attitude can be used to justify all kinds of things, and I think probably leads to alienation, not only from the natural world, but from each other, as well.</p>
<p>I actually had been writing my way around this story for a while, had done a good deal of research, and I had a lot of the material for it already ⎯ the setting, the characters ⎯ but it wasn’t coming together. Then one day, for some reason, the dog worked his way in there and after that he kind of became the still point at the center, with the rest of the story revolving around this one incident.</p>
<p>2.) This may go along with the first question, but did you grow up in a community similar to the one you depict?</p>
<p>No, I grew up in Albuquerque, though some of the places where I’ve lived have affinities with the community in the story. I’ve always been fascinated with very insular fictional settings, small contained worlds, so may of my stories seem to take place in small towns. I did do some research though, on the geography and the history of the region, especially the troubled recent economic and agricultural history, because I wanted the story to ring true to people who actually live there. But, in the end, it’s mostly imaginary.</p>
<p>3.) What is your writing process like?</p>
<p>I wish I had a good answer to this question, but I’m still figuring it out myself! It seems to change with every story. I try (and often fail) to write for a while every morning. Usually I have to start a story over several times, making slightly more progress each time, until I find a voice that can carry me all the way to the end. When I finish a first draft I like to put it away and work on other things for a while ⎯ at least a month but often more ⎯ so that I can come back to it with fresh eyes. Sometimes I abandon a story at that point, but if it still resonates when I pick it up again, then I like to do a kind of “self-workshop” where I write myself a letter about the story, as honestly as I can. After I address those criticisms in revision (which can take a long time), then it’s time to show it to people. It’s a pretty slow process.</p>
<p>4.) How long have you been writing and what got you started in writing?</p>
<p>I’ve been writing since high school, and writing “seriously” since college, though there have been some gaps. I think I must have started writing in an English class in high school, but I actually don’t remember the moment I thought, “I’m going to try this now.” I know that I have had a number of incredibly supportive teachers, without whom writing might not have morphed from hobby to passion.</p>
<p>5.) Who are some authors who have inspired you?</p>
<p>Too many to list, but the writers who I think most inspired this story are Alice Munro, David Means, Stephanie Vaughn (in particular her story “Dog Heaven,” which is just such an incredible story), Junot Diaz (especially the stories in Drown), and William Maxwell (especially So Long, See You Tomorrow, which I actually read after I had finished a draft of “The Gully” but which was helpful in revision). I also took a lot of inspiration from the poetry of Richard Hugo and Alice Notley.</p>
<p>More generally, the writers I come back to again and again include Alice Munro, Cormac McCarthy, Roberto Bolaño, and especially Virginia Woolf.</p>
