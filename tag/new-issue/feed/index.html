<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p><em>Flyway </em>is excited to post new content for winter 2015! Place and belonging are the twin themes linking this month’s content—what it means to belong to a place, to be an outsider, or to feel like an outsider in your own home.</p>
<p>In non-fiction, we bring you the 2014 Notes from the Field winner and runner-up. Our winning entry is Susannah Clark’s “House Blend,” a delicate and engrossing essay about the Boston Marathon bombings that weaves together the author’s experiences working in a coffee shop in Inman Square—an up-and-coming neighborhood in Cambridge where both the author and the Tsarnaev brothers lived—with ruminations on place, community and belonging. Our runner-up, “Usciolu” by Suzanne Menghraj, explores similar themes: in her essay—part travelogue, part memoir—a hiking trip through Corsica gives Menghraj a lens through which to explore racism and human connection.</p>
<p>In poetry, we have spare, beautiful poems by Kathleen Kirk and Rachel Morgan that discover startling revelations in the natural world. Finally, in fiction we bring you a short story from Eric Maus about displacement, as a young man wanders Heidelberg with the night’s temporary drinking companions, looking for love, or simply connection.</p>
<p>In art, we have photographs by Nicola Beuscher exploring the lonely landscape of Cape Cod in the winter, haunting and empty without its tourists, and a macro- and micro-view of the world—planets, plants, and plasma—from artist Jake Ford.</p>
<p>And don’t forget the <em>Flyway</em> blog, where we’ll be posting book reviews, web roves and interviews to keep you sated between new issues. You won’t want to miss poetry editor Samantha Futhey’s great interview with Alison Hawthorne Deming, published last Thursday.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this issue’s new content!</p>
<p>And finally, a word to our readers: Changes are afoot here at <em>Flyway</em>! You may have noticed a break in our normal six-week publication cycle. That’s because <em>Flyway </em>is moving toward a new publication schedule: We’ll be putting out four quarterly issues a year, with special issues released in the summer and winter. We hope this shift will allow us not only to continue to offer the best poetry, non-fiction, fiction and art exploring place and environment on the web, but also give us the flexibility to seek out exciting new voices and produce theme issues built around various artistic and environmental questions.</p>
<p>We at <em>Flyway</em> are excited about our new content, our new direction, and, as always, you: Thanks for reading! Let us know what you think about the new issue in the comments.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Liz Giorgi</p>
<p>Managing Editor</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SEPTEMBER 2014: NEW CONTENT!</p>
<p>Whether you’re kicking off a new academic year, wriggling under the weight of the dog days, or enthusiastically imbibing the heat of summer before it turns into fall, you want to make some room in your schedule for <i>Flyway’s</i> September, 2014, publication cycle.</p>
<p>To put your mind in an artistic mood, you may want to start by investigating our new visuals: evocative macro-photographs by Carolyn Guinzio.</p>
<p>Then head to our non-fiction sector — delight yourself with local food, fiddleheads, and fireflies. Allegra Hyde shares her experience preparing a locally-sourced meal on a Bahamian island in “Coming to the Table”; in “Eating Pieces of the Universe,” Pamela Baker remembers her youth in Maine, foraging for fiddleheads with her father, while she copes with her father’s new-found cancer; and Megan Ewald connects a familial disaster with her passion for the natural world and the magic of fireflies in her essay “Finding Luminescence.”</p>
<p>Our two new pieces of fiction this month visit the dark side, and you won’t be able to stop reading them. In Alisha Karabinus’s ”When Henry Sayles Ate a Bullet,” explore the depression and suicide of a police officer who’s downfall is deeply intertwined with the decline of his small Illinois town. And witness a wrenching freeway accident with the disgruntled narrator of Caleb Stone’s story “Tough World for Tigers.”</p>
<p>Last but never least, we’re featuring three new poems this month that are sure to bewitch you. “Surfeit” by Katherine L. Hester and “A Good Death” by Anne Haven McDonnell capture and reconstitute the pulsing season of summer in two extraordinarily unique, visceral ways. On a different track, fast-paced narrative poem “To the Man Who Ordered the Pad Kee Mow,” by Doc Suds, will have you looking at your ethnic food differently for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Enjoy this work, and thank you for reading, everyone!</p>
<p>*-*</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Flyway</em> is pleased to bring you our first new content of 2014.</p>
<p>*  Poetry by Oet, Hanson, and D’Andrea<br />
*  Nonfiction by Troisi and McNally<br />
*  Fiction by Thomann<br />
*  Art by Nierenberg and Nodopaka</p>
<p>This January, the <em>Flyway</em> editors saw record cold temperatures here in Iowa. So it seems appropriate that this month’s crop of work pulls us (mostly) elsewhere to (somewhat) warmer climes. Peruse our work and travel to New York with a porcupine in Oet’s poem “Hookey”, or count antelopes in Wyoming in Hanson’s poem “Landscape Art.” Travel to New Hampshire in Troisi’s stirring essay, “Until the Morning Comes” and D’Andrea’s Home Voices* winning poem, “Rock Wall, New Hampshire.” Explore Lava Beds in California with John Muir and the Modoc Indians in McNally’s essay, “When John Muir Missed the Center of the World.” Return back to Iowa in Thomann’s Home Voices*, Runner-Up story, “Flood Gap,&#8221; and explore the oceans with Nodopaka&#8217;s whimsical fish compositions. Finally, go internal and contemplate the nature of womanhood with Nieremberg&#8217;s dynamic and moving visual art.</p>
<p>*-*</p>
<p>*Every year <em>Flyway</em> runs the Home Voices Contest where a guest judge chooses a winner and runner-up from work by the MFA graduate students at ISU. This year’s judge was Elizabeth Bradfield, who is the founder and editor-in-chief of <a title="Broadside Press" href="http://www.broadsidedpress.org/about-eds.shtml" target="_blank">Broadsided Press</a> and author of <em>Approaching Ice</em>.</p>
