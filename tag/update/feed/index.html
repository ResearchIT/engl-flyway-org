								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Flyway</em> is pleased to bring you our first new content of 2014.</p>
<p>*  Poetry by Oet, Hanson, and D’Andrea<br />
*  Nonfiction by Troisi and McNally<br />
*  Fiction by Thomann<br />
*  Art by Nierenberg and Nodopaka</p>
<p>This January, the <em>Flyway</em> editors saw record cold temperatures here in Iowa. So it seems appropriate that this month’s crop of work pulls us (mostly) elsewhere to (somewhat) warmer climes. Peruse our work and travel to New York with a porcupine in Oet’s poem “Hookey”, or count antelopes in Wyoming in Hanson’s poem “Landscape Art.” Travel to New Hampshire in Troisi’s stirring essay, “Until the Morning Comes” and D’Andrea’s Home Voices* winning poem, “Rock Wall, New Hampshire.” Explore Lava Beds in California with John Muir and the Modoc Indians in McNally’s essay, “When John Muir Missed the Center of the World.” Return back to Iowa in Thomann’s Home Voices*, Runner-Up story, “Flood Gap,&#8221; and explore the oceans with Nodopaka&#8217;s whimsical fish compositions. Finally, go internal and contemplate the nature of womanhood with Nieremberg&#8217;s dynamic and moving visual art.</p>
<p>*-*</p>
<p>*Every year <em>Flyway</em> runs the Home Voices Contest where a guest judge chooses a winner and runner-up from work by the MFA graduate students at ISU. This year’s judge was Elizabeth Bradfield, who is the founder and editor-in-chief of <a title="Broadside Press" href="http://www.broadsidedpress.org/about-eds.shtml" target="_blank">Broadsided Press</a> and author of <em>Approaching Ice</em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I know many of you are eagerly awaiting the latest issue of <em>Flyway</em>. As you know, we got it to the printer a bit later than we might have liked&#8211;but it&#8217;s there now and we hope to have it back in time for AWP (meaning, we hope to have it back in early April). The printer says there will be about a 3-week turn around&#8211;but I know from experience that this is the average. This issue contains winners from two contests: Notes from the Field (creative prose about the environment) and Home Voices (open only to members of the Iowa State creative writing graduate program). We also feature two artists (artists&#8217; work is solicited; we do not accept unsolicited artwork).</p>
<p>On another note, we need more of you to inkle! That&#8217;s what we call it (thanks to the suggestion of a long-time contributor) when you respond to one of our Monthly Inklings. The month is already (almost) halfway over! Remember, the winning Inklings will be feature here!</p>
