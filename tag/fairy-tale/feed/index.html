								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our fiction editor, Lydia Melby, offers some reading suggestions for all things fairy tale. Too cold outside? Stay in and stoke your imagination with this week&#8217;s web rove, full of interviews, novel excerpts, reviews, and even a web comic.</p>
<p>-*-</p>
<p>If you arent reading Electric Literature&#8217;s &#8220;Recommended Reading,&#8221; then you&#8217;ve got some serious catch-up to play. I love this blog as much for the recommender&#8217;s notes as for the brilliant, and usually new to me, stories or excerpts they suggest. Here are some recommendations:<br />
<a href="http://recommendedreading.tumblr.com/post/37784039877/dan-josefson-feeling">Dan Josefson&#8217;s </a><em><a href="http://recommendedreading.tumblr.com/post/37784039877/dan-josefson-feeling">That&#8217;s Not a Feeling</a>, </em>_novel excerpt<br />
Here, Soho Press and Tom Bissell suggest an excerpt from Dan Josefson&#8217;s <em>That&#8217;s Not a Feeling</em>&#8211;and yes, this brief taste suggests the book is just as good as everyone and their mother has suggested.</p>
<p><a href="http://recommendedreading.tumblr.com/post/28479950929/steven-millhauser-cathay">Steven Milhauser&#8217;s &#8220;Cathay&#8221;</a><br />
Here, Aimee Bender recommends surreal master Steven Milhauser&#8217;s strange and wondrous world, narrated in mysteries.</p>
<p><a href="http://recommendedreading.tumblr.com/post/34697098370/j-robert-lennon-cottage-hill">J. Robert Lennon&#8217;s &#8220;The Cottage on the Hill&#8221;</a><br />
And finally, J. Robert Lennon&#8217;s quietly unsettling story offers one much to ponder, and is suggested by the new journal <em>Unstuck.</em><em></em></p>
<p>*<br />
Speaking of <em><a href="http://unstuckbooks.org/">Unstuck</a>,</em> our fiction editor would like to point out it&#8217;s the journal she&#8217;s currently most excited about. They explain themselves on their website as an &#8220;independent, non-profit annual journal&#8221; dedicated to literary fiction with elements of the fantastic, the futuristic, or the surreal&#8230; In our pages, you&#8217;ll find everything from straight-up science fiction and fantasy to domestic realism with a twist of the improbable.&#8221;</p>
<p>While you&#8217;ll have to subscribe to get the full wondrous experience, <em>Unstuck</em>&#8216;s website provides <a href="http://www.unstuckbooks.org/interviews-excerpts">excerpts and interviews</a> that will just make you want more.</p>
<p>*<br />
If you&#8217;ve got that constant fairy tale itch, like some of our staff, here&#8217;s a great <a href="http://onpoint.wbur.org/2012/10/17/grimm-brothers-fairy-tales">NPR podcast with Tom Ashbrook and Maria Tatar</a> (high queen of fairy tale scholarship) discussing fairy tales and their history in celebration of her new translation, &#8220;The Annotated Brother&#8217;s Grimm (The Bicentennial Edition).&#8221; Depending on your obsession, you may have come across some of the things and themes covered, but overall it&#8217;s a lovely and interesting discussion of the bedtime tales still affecting us today. <span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> </span></p>
<p>*<br />
<a href="http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=1132&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media=">Jill Steinhauer, &#8220;The Gorey Details&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Jill Steinhauer reviews Edward Gorey&#8217;s works and influence on her and many of us, offering an insightful, interesting discussion of his art, his mystery, and, well, his gorey-ness (pun intended!), ultimately offering us an peek into the artist&#8217;s &#8220;theory of life&#8221; as &#8220;inexplicable&#8221; put into striking, memorable art.</p>
<p>Also, the Los Angeles Review of Books is such a perfect place to read about all the books and art and themes of life you&#8217;ve always wanted to see discussed.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><a href="http://hemlock.smackjeeves.com/comics/893745/0-00/"> &#8220;Hemlock,&#8221; Joscelyn Fenton</a> (web comic)</p>
<p>For our readers who love graphic novels and comics as well as the written word, here&#8217;s a great web comic (still updating!) about a Scandinavian country witch named Lumi (whose house is built into the shell of her giant snail). &#8220;Hemlock&#8221; plays on the well-loved Baba Yaga myth, but Lumi&#8217;s story is fresh, fun, and exciting (and quite visually gorgeous).</p>
