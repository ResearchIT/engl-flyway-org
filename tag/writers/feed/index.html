								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just last Sunday, we hosted our annual Flyway Benefit Auction to great success. Thank you to everyone who donated something by participating in one of the events we featured Sunday night. For those friends of Flyway who couldn&#8217;t be there in person, thank you for always being there in spirit. We are about to undergo some big changes, so your support mean all the more to us at this time!</p>
<p>To celebrate the post-benefit/ post-election, here are a few creative selections from around the web in this week&#8217;s web rove:</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/mean/arthur-krystal-and-everyones-favorite-genre-fiction-fallacy/">Arthur Krystal and Everyone&#8217;s Favorite Genre Fiction Fallacy</a>&#8220;<em> </em>by Mike Meginnis (from <em>HTML Giant</em>)<br />
Mike bends and blurs genre; such as his recent &#8220;Navigators&#8221; originally published in <em>Hobart</em> and then included in the <em>Best American Short Stories 2013</em>. He also defends and defines genre as way to compel plot, while also still being a good story. Have a read and then weigh in on the conversation in the comments section.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/343316/the-artist-and-the-critic-8-famous-authoreditor-relationships">The Artist and the Critic</a>&#8221; by Emily Temple (from <em>Flavorwire)</em><br />
Last fall I read the tome <em>Max Perkins: Editor of Genius</em> by biographer A. Scott Berg, which includes the Scribner editor&#8217;s trying relationships with a trifecta of the famous authors F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe. This list of eight editing relationships starts with Perkins and Wolfe, but includes seven other pairings. Throughout them all consider how an editor is a super-reader for a writer.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.worldhum.com/features/travel-stories/why-we-travel-20081213/">Why We Travel</a>&#8221; by Pico Iyer (from <em>WorldHum</em>)<br />
This is a manifesto from a transnational who has witnessed the world by participating in it via travel. Iyer shows both directions of leaving and returning: what we take there and what we bring back. Go on an imaginative trip just by reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/oct/24/simon-garfield-top-10-maps">Top 10 Books with Maps</a>&#8221; by Simon Garfield (from <em>the Guardian</em>)<br />
As cliche as it sounds for this to be a starting point on a journey of maps, this list offers just that. These books include maps on the author&#8217;s radar. Of course, there&#8217;s more than just these ten, so why not add to the list your own favorite maps in books?</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/443/please_dont_vote_for_me">Please Don&#8217;t Vote for Me</a>&#8221; by Sparrow (from <em>the Sun</em>)<br />
As the editors note: &#8220;The poet and political provocateur Sparrow has run for U.S. president in every election since 1992. Sometimes he runs as a Republican and other times as a member of a party of his own invention — the Pajama Party, the Ear of Corn Party, the Sudoku for All Party. To his knowledge he has never received any votes, but this seems only to encourage him.&#8221; Find out why Sparrow even runs, what his &#8220;issues&#8221; are, and how he never gets any votes in this tongue-in-cheek piece.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey friends of Flyway, read on below for some of our editor&#8217;s selected reads from around the web. Happy November!</p>
<p><a href="http://brevitymag.com/current-issue/choom/" target="_blank"> “Choom”</a> / by: Jenny Boully (nonfiction in <em>Brevity</em>)<br />
Through a concise and lyrical list of details about a woman, BaNoi, a child deciphers her bewildering life.</p>
<p>“Mother says she would not like to die in this country; she says that when she dies, if she should die here, please take her home; she does not like what they do to dead bodies in this country; she says she will need monks to help carry her home.”</p>
<p><a href="http://annalemma.net/features/hostages.html" target="_blank">“Hostages”</a> / by Shannon Heffernan (fiction in <em>Annalemma</em>)<br />
Twin sisters negotiate secrets and their evolving relationship amidst a hostage situation happening in a nearby apartment building.</p>
<p>“Karen sits back in the tub. For a second she seems like a stranger and I try to figure out if she’s beautiful or ugly. But I love her and hate her too much to know what either of us really looks like.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sixthfinch.com/hogan1.html" target="_blank"> “Of Belief in the Nonexistence in Worlds that are Not our Own” </a>and <a href="http://sixthfinch.com/hogan2.html" target="_blank">“Scenes from a Massacre”</a> / by John Fenlon Hogan (poetry in <em>Sixth Finch</em>)<br />
I don’t really know what to say about these poems except that, after reading them, I wanted to find and immediately read Hogan’s other work!</p>
<p>“And I have seen enough movies to know / that I don’t know the world is almost / ending often, and I know of no other way / to woo her than with a sense of too much / fate.”</p>
<p><a href="http://thejournalmag.org/archives/2122" target="_blank">“Anatomy”</a> / by: Valerie Wetlaufer (poetry in <em>The Journal</em>)<br />
Birds and the body. Gorgeous language. Even the form attempts flight right out of this poem.</p>
<p>“My best lines to you are composed on vellum, the skin of a stillborn lamb. / I scrape the hide clean, / remove the hairs and rub it smooth with pumice.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last, meet <em>Flyway&#8217;s </em>creative director/ web czaress, <strong>Lindsay D&#8217;Andrea</strong>. You can find her updating the blog, tweeting, managing our Facebook page, and helping layout issue design. Consider her a behind-the-scenes editor.</p>
<div id="attachment_830" style="width: 376px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/newhair1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-830" class=" wp-image-830     " title="Lindsay D'Andrea" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/newhair1.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="302" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-830" class="wp-caption-text">Lindsay, with her most creative hair</p></div>
<p><strong><br />
What book can you not stop talking to people about?<br />
</strong>Ever since we circulated Anthony Doerr&#8217;s books around before last year&#8217;s <em>Wildness Symposium</em>, it&#8217;s been his collection of short stories, <em>The Shell Collector</em>. I just can&#8217;t get over how textured, heart-rending, complex, and epic Doerr stories are, and I recommend them to everyone. If you haven&#8217;t read it yet, that needs to be the first thing on your list. Starting now.</p>
<p><strong><br />
What book compels your writing?</strong><em></em><br />
I&#8217;ve read a lot of books on craft &#8212; too many, I think. Obviously <em>The Art of Fiction</em> is a staple. More than reading, though, I learn most from my professors and peers and the invaluable advice they give. Actually, from a different perspective, I feel most compelled to write by reading poetry<strong>, </strong>and my go-to (for now) has been  Stephen Dunn.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?<br />
I jump all over the place, sampling from a bunch of different online and print journals. I really like <em>Hayden&#8217;s Ferry</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, <em>Ecotone</em> (hurray for environmentally-minded journals!),<em> Necessary Fiction, the Rumpus, Orion, The Southern Review, AQR</em> &#8212; plus a lot more. I also love the visual art featured on <em>Escape into Life</em> and <em>Society 6</em>.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?<br />
Oh, gosh. I usually look for writers that have been on my &#8220;must-read-more&#8221; list like Karen Russell, Lauren Groff and Meghan Mayhew Bergman, but usually I read journals for the unknowns (like myself). I will just pick stories and poems at random and read them, with hope that someone out there is doing the same for me. I usually then try to follow those emerging writers on Twitter. Our technological internet-driven age means that reading shouldn&#8217;t be passive anymore&#8230;our capacity for communication is too great to ignore.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?<br />
Send us your best! A lot of times I feel like we get stories that have not been polished or edited properly or extensively. We have pretty high standards, here, and we always want the best you can give. For visual art, I look for interesting composition (in photographs) or complex relationships between visual elements. Obviously, we &#8220;like&#8221; plants and rocks and fields and pastorals, but that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re really about&#8230;surprise us with your new ideas about the environment&#8230;it&#8217;s changing at a rate that can no longer sustain a boxed-in definition.<strong></strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Fiction editor Lydia Melby reviews the latest collection by one of her favorite authors.</em></p>
<p>&#8211; * &#8211;</p>
<p>October is a time for stories about the uncanny, the unexpected, and the feared. The cooling air and paling daylight brings a sense of a thinning barrier, an atmosphere ripe for the appearance of signs to decode. And in his newest collection of short stories, <em>Stay Awake</em>, Dan Chaon gives us these stories, increasing the atmospheric pressure with each sentence, each blank section break, and we grow more and more uneasy as we read, and cannot stop.</p>
<p>In <em>Stay Awake, </em>children wake up   screaming. Parents fall asleep at the wheel. Men wake up choking, some with notes they aren’t sure they wrote, and can’t quite understand. Parents lean over their children in the dark, watching them sleep, reaching for them. Three girls sleep through their own attempted murder, and some day in the future, a girl will wake up with the memory of the presence of another inside her own mind, a voice that whispers “<em>I’m still awake.” </em>And she will wonder what it means, like the author writing, like us who read, they all wonder what it means.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to understand.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780345530370-0" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px none; margin: 2px 10px;" src="http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20120217-stay-awake.jpg.ece/BINARY/w620x413/STAY+AWAKE.jpg" alt="" width="191" height="289" /></a><br />
In “I Wake Up,” Rob describes his disorientation as “that sense of grasping, a foot coming down and not finding the ground.” It’s a sense we feel more and more as each story progresses, even worse because at first, we <em>can</em> find the ground, or so we think, as each story grows out of a heavy realism. These people are the sort of characters we expect from Chaon—the drifting, the tired, the quiet members of society who creep along in its outer edges. People who live in the wide, blank loneliness of the Midwest, who bag groceries or drive semis. These are characters who’ve all lost someone, often in ways we consciously dread, or have even seen.</p>
<p>Like the father in the title story, everyone is looking for some sort of answer. After a long struggle to conceive, Zach’s baby Rosalie is born with   two heads  joined at the crown, mirror-image faces, a “parasitic  twin” incapable of life without Rosalie’s body. <em>Why do people want to have babies? </em>Zach and his wife wonder, and as the answer approaches us, Chaon disconnects the narrative in a way that we read the whole story again, dreading that hint we’re sure we missed the first time around.</p>
<p>These stories, each told in the simple, melancholy prose we’ve come to love about Chaon’s work, mine that richness of possibility, that foreboding, not revealing what is waiting in the dark or on the other side of the door, looking at us through the window, but not fully in view. The best of these will cause a visceral reaction, a choking   feeling in your throat, something growing  in the back of your skull, “a flicker of consciousness would wink on and off.”</p>
<p>And as the answer approaches like in “Slowly We Open Our Eyes,” as “that awful, inevitable feeling…the ticking of a roulette wheel as the marble finally settles in place, ” Chaon cuts us off with our own, “Oh my God.”</p>
<p>This is not to say these stories leave us hanging. Many are well-written but predictable—<em>“</em>St. Dismas,” “The Bees,” “Long Expected, Always Delayed,” “Thinking of You in Your Time of Sorrow.”</p>
<p>Others give us answers that are there, eerily within our reach.</p>
<p>When Critter in <em>To Psychic Underworld:</em> loses his wife, he begins to find little notes—stickies in the library about cybersex, a frantic love letter on a dollar bill, a single, plaintive word on every napkin in a clean stack. The messages grow more pointed, more private, until the last is spoken directly into his mind as he nears an inevitable breaking point that we don’t see, but expect.</p>
<p>And his survival is a stronger possibility than perhaps the saddest of these characters— Brandon in <em>Patrick Lane, Flabbergasted</em>, a young man living alone in the same house his parents killed themselves in. His world is slowly shrinking, his living space confining itself to the humming fort of the electronics that circle his bed, shrinking just as irrevocably as the window for his escape. The end to this story is as final and definite as we don’t want it to be.</p>
<p>But it’s the final story, “The Farm. The Gold. The Lily White Hands.” that most evokes a sense of otherworldly, a feeling as if a person you were speaking to stared at something over your shoulder, and then   jumped. It’s the story I’ve read again and again, read aloud to myself and to unfortunate friends. It’s Chaon’s most experimental to date, and it’s the kind of story that will only exist once, a flawless sustained gasp. Chaon slowly, quietly, fills us first with sadness, then with dread, poured like a stream of cold, wet sand, bringing us the dreams we never wanted to admit we’d had, had and savored, and   remembered the next  morning  whenever it was we   woke up.</p>
<p>Because we do understand each other. We do understand.</p>
<p>And perhaps that’s why we jump, even though it’s the most commonplace thing in the world, when the wife waiting at our bedside looks up surprised, or the mother leaning over us in the dark touches our shoulder.</p>
<p><em>Oh</em>, she says. <em>You’re   awake</em></p>
<p>&#8211; * &#8211;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Our new <em>Flyway</em> fiction editor, Lydia Melby, is straight outta Texas (but don&#8217;t tell her I told you). Read below for more important information.</p>
<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><em><br />
The God of Small Things</em>. &#8230;</p>]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our new <em>Flyway</em> fiction editor, Lydia Melby, is straight outta Texas (but don&#8217;t tell her I told you). Read below for more important information.</p>
<div id="attachment_821" style="width: 319px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/220038_808697576957_1520514839_o.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-821" class=" wp-image-821     " title="Lydia with Wolf Pup" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/220038_808697576957_1520514839_o.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="232" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-821" class="wp-caption-text">Lydia with Wolf Pup</p></div>
<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><em><br />
The God of Small Things</em>. <em>Ship Breaker</em>. Mary Karr’s memoirs. Do I need to pick one? Sometimes I want to read a fast-paced YA novel about the futuristic Gulf communities complete with clipper ship chase scenes, and sometimes I want to read a lovely, lyrical novel dissecting how small choices and small betrayals can all pile together for a catastrophic end. Sometimes I want to read a fellow Texan’s sassy-assed recounting of her life and thoughts about religion, family, and writing. I’m reading <em>The Night Circus</em> right now, too, and it’s fantastic—it’s difficult to stay on track with my class readings when I have such a lively, brilliant story within reach. I’ve been putting it away in my room when I work.</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><em><br />
The English Patient</em>, ultimately (or really, anything by Ondaatje). I’ve never read a more perfectly realized, more devastating book (though <em>The God of Small Things</em> and <em>The Cat’s Table </em>come close). I read<em> Stay Awake </em>this summer and was floored. I’m reading it for the third time now—Chaon’s eerie lyricism is so subtle and so atmospheric that you get that ringing in your ears.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I read <em>The Fairy Tale Review, The Southern Review, American Short Fiction </em>(please don’t shut down!)<em>, Ecotone, Idaho Review, Gulf Coast, Bellevue, Bat City, </em>and<em> Fiddleblack, </em>cover to cover, and really love<em> The Collagist, DrunkenBoat,  Fwriction, Pank, Lit, Granta, The Paris Review, The Atlantic, A Capella Zoo, Pleiades, Ninth Letter, Sonora Review</em> and too many to really name.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
Upper Middle Class White Male Authors. Especially if they’re long-established voices, have published several times, and are writing about hetero-normative relationships taking place in New York City/LA/The Midwest. I really like it when their narrator is speaking in first person present, is frustrated with how he’s not understood by family/society, and/or has an epiphany about how their wife/ girlfriend/ new baby makes them feel trapped.</p>
<p>Obviously (I hope), that’s sarcasm. I look for writers that can shock me, writers I don’t necessarily recognize, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
I feel like a lot of current short stories tend to ignore the necessity of a compelling plot to lean on other elements—like an idiosyncratic voice, or really detailed descriptions. I don’t mean that I’d rather mostly plot, but I’m looking for balanced stories—and yeah, that’s hard to do.</p>
<p>Personally, I really enjoy tension and a sense of mystery. Or, to quote Raymond Carver, I want to read stories with at least &#8220;a little menace…There has to be tension, a sense that something is imminent, that certain things are in relentless motion, or else, most often, there simply won&#8217;t be a story.&#8221;</p>
<p>For <em>Flyway</em> in particular, there should be tension between the environment or setting of the story and the characters in it. A well-known place should appear new, even alien and strange through the eyes and actions of the characters. I want to see an active environment, too—a setting that influences actions, triggers it’s one events.</p>
<p>One of my professors has a Dianne Arbus photo on his wall—the one of the frustrated little boy holding a grenade in central park—and he pointed out part of what makes the photo so memorable (besides the little critter’s facial contortions) is that she had a special lens that made the background and environment tilted, a little bent-looking, while the foreground was in realistically sharp focus. He said that’s the kind of story he likes to read and write—one where the center is sharp and realistic, and the outer edges are starting to bend or collapse.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">“Summer is for reading books about the end of the world”<br />
— A friend, on summer reads</p>
<p>Most of what I’ve been reading this summer could be called speculative fiction, or near-future, or post-apocalyptic, or just good ol’ sci-fi. Books about the end of the world fascinate me, and I’ve read some rewardingly sinister predictions, some hopeful projections about rebuilding, and some kooky excuses to dismiss social progress in the name of returning humans to their ‘natural’ state. Among the crumbling governments and strange technologies I’ve been exploring, Paolo Bacigalupi’s whirlwind novel, <em>The Windup Girl</em>, which won the 2010 Hugo and Nebula awards and many other honors, stands apart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/0-9781597801577-0"><img class="aligncenter" title="Wind-up Girl cover" src="http://chamberfour.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/the-windup-girl-shopped.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>The narrative offers Bacigalupi’s startling vision of a world where oil has run out, ending the days of the Old Expansion; where companies like SoyPro, U-Tex, and AgriGen filled the world’s fields with genehacked crops so non-diverse they were wiped out by a couple of engineered plagues, where technology has lead to chameleonic cat infestations and 15-ton elephants are used as work animals, and where “windups”—New People engineered to be strong, beautiful, and instinctually subservient—are used to fulfill human whims.</p>
<p>But Bacigalupi doesn’t spend his time marveling over these strange events and making sure the reader knows precisely how they came about, since these events are history in this world; instead he places his narrative in the days of the “New Expansion,” when nations have rebuilt to some degree, when clipper ships and high-tech dirigibles have become commonplace again, when all technology—from crank-fans to treadle-computers—is powered by human energy, and when civil wars and political coup d’états are again concerns as big as the food supply. He evokes a world that has, at least somewhat, adapted to its own end, and is fighting to survive another.</p>
<p>While this level of complex world-building seems overwhelming at first, Bacigalupi achieves a sense of causality and wholeness in his new world. The reader is not bogged down with superfluous details and explanations of “what went wrong” and “how stuff works now,&#8221; but is rather immersed in a completely fresh era and place which may take some getting used to, but is tangible and constant. By containing his narrative in Bangkok, Thailand, Bacigalupi shows how the worldwide events have radically affected this microcosm, allowing him to reasonably hint at the struggles the rest of the world is facing without writing a 1200 page novel.</p>
<p>He also gives a multi-faceted view of the Bangkok microcosm, as the narrative rotates among four main characters—Emiko, the mysterious ‘windup’ of the title; Anderson Lake, a ‘calorie man’ spy sent by the megalithic AgriGen to seek out Thailand’s seedbank in hope of “generipping” its riches; Tan Hock Seng, a former shipping king and “yellow card” (Chinese refugee), who schemes to regain his former wealth and status; and Captain Jaidee Rojjanasukchai of the Thai Environment Ministry, called “The Tiger of Bangkok” for his fierce dedication to the environmental health of the city he loves. These four are joined by an array of supporting characters just as diverse (but not to worry, Bacigalupi’s taken care to give them memorable names, e.g. “Dog Fucker”).</p>
<p>But the true protagonist of the story is Bacigalupi’s city of Bangkok, or Krung Thep, depending on the narrator’s nationality. He has clearly done his research on the challenges facing present-day Thailand, and offers a vision of a struggling nation’s capital fighting rising sea levels and rampant disease mutations. While each of the human characters fight for their own interests and reveal their own dark sides, it’s this hopeful, but broken city in a strange and broken world that the reader comes to care for most in the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://windupstories.com"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://windupstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/paolobacigalupi300dpi.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="253" /></a></p>
<p>While I’m partial to as many characters as one can stuff into a story, some readers might find the story crowded; likewise, Bacigalupi’s constantly shifting narrative, and one particularly daring perspective shift, might contradict expected storytelling ‘rules’. However, these characters—each of different ethnicity and social standing, each with their own complex loyalties and desires—are one of the elements that set this story apart from other speculative fiction or futuristic novels.</p>
<p><em>The Windup Girl</em> isn’t strictly a cautionary tale (though one might wish certain FDA officials would read it), and it’s not a trip through one writer’s imaginative paranoia, either. The novel is Bacigalupi’s vision of our world in a possible future—a frightening, exciting, and even sometimes hopeful vision of what happens when resources are abused, communities taken for granted, and everyone—deserving or not—gets what is coming.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em> </em>Hello readers and <em>Flyway</em> friends!</p>
<p>Hopefully everyone out there has been enjoying the summer and getting outside in the sun a bit. We are back from a short summer hiatus, bringing you an excellent new interview with Wendell Berry and Wes Jackson, by Kristin Van Tassel and Aubrey Streit Krug.</p>
<p>Keep checking back for upcoming Summer Reading Reviews by members of the new <em>Flyway</em> staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">OUR COMMON GROUND</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wendell-Wes-iii.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-699" title="Wendell &amp; Wes" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wendell-Wes-iii.jpg" alt="" width="518" height="242" /></a></p>
<p>Thirty-five years ago, Wendell Berry’s <em>The Unsettling of America</em> challenged agribusiness as the optimal model for farming in America, and since then Berry has been America’s most compelling advocate for ecological agrarianism. Around the same time, Wes Jackson was founding The Land Institute, a nonprofit organization where scientists are working to develop an agricultural system that mimics the ecosystem of the prairie, namely through the development of perennial grain cropping systems.</p>
<p>Over the course of three decades, these two world-renowned farmers–one a fiction writer and poet in Kentucky, the other a scientist in Kansas–have influenced, challenged, and entertained each other. Despite their very different training and approaches to exploring the world, their friendship has been a vital source of mutual creative inspiration. T<ins cite="mailto:Andrew%20Payton" datetime="2012-04-12T16:04"></ins>hrough the frequent exchange of letters and phone calls, they have developed new ideas and revised old ones, collaborating on a number of projects, most recently the essay “A 50-Year Farm Bill,” which appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> op-ed page. In an era of increasing abstraction and specialization, where personal connections are understood in terms of digital “networks,” Wendell Berry and Wes Jackson have instead forged a lasting friendship based upon their mutual respect for the earth.</p>
<p>Kristin Van Tassel and Aubrey Streit Krug interviewed the pair at Jackson&#8217;s home near The Land Institute, located a few miles south of Salina in Central Kansas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Van Tassel:</strong> You’ve written a lot about male friendship in your fiction, Wendell. But you’ve also mentioned in interviews that there are restraints on how men can show love and affection for one another, especially in public. So I wondered if you could talk about why this is the case for male friendship but also why male friendship is important. Do you see your friendship with Wes as extending beyond the boundaries of what’s typical for male friendship in intellectual circles or rural places?</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> I never thought to classify and label it as “male friendship.” My friendships have had their significance in being distinct, not in being alike. I don’t have much of anything to compare with this friendship. Wes is the only scientist with whom I have really talked over a long time. In some ways, I don’t think of him as a scientist but as a partner or co-worker, and also as a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Wendell’s ideas greatly influenced my thinking and therefore The Land Institute for three decades. Wendell’s education in the humanities having influenced the scientific discussion here shows what is possible for the universities; knowledge can be forced out of its categories.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> I’m enabled, too, in the opposite way because as a critic of agriculture, which I guess I am in a way, I’m necessarily a critic of science. I know most agricultural scientists are not going to respond to me because I can be safely ignored. Nevertheless, if I can get an idea past Wes, then I have a certain boldness to speak that I wouldn’t have otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Wendell has said to me many times, &#8220;All<ins cite="mailto:Lauren%20Zastrow" datetime="2012-04-07T13:58"></ins> adaptation is local.” This informs my idea of the ecological, and my ideas of the ecological have informed his idea of the local. This is the way it ought to be.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> When I say all adaptation is local, I’m talking about what I think is science. But if I didn’t have a scientist to say it to—who would either stop me or let me say it—I would not know. Maybe you could say we’ve given each other a kind of completeness neither of us would have had alone. There’s a kind of confidence that comes with this sort of alliance. You can think of it as a friendship from an internal point of view, but as it faces the world, it’s an alliance because we’ve got opponents out there. So we need each other for help.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Exactly. Wendell has said that in a conversation you have to respect the otherness of the other, and you don’t always get back the answer you want. But what you get back informs the next. If you have a friendship, you automatically have respect for the other. Now you can have a conversation. Think about how many conversations are unnecessarily combative. It becomes a competition rather than a mutual search. And that’s what it should be—a search.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wendell-Wes-ii.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-701" title="Wendell &amp; Wes 3" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wendell-Wes-ii.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="372" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Van Tassel:</strong> How do you maintain your relationship? How often do you call one another or write? Is it something you just find yourself doing? Is it something you’ve committed to do?</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> Well, I call Wes to see if he’ll let me say something. I think of something with a scientific aspect to it, and I know I’ve got to call him up. I’ll say, “I’m going to say this—is that all right?” And he’ll say, “Yeah, go ahead and say that.” Or he’ll say, “Wait a minute.”</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> We used to write more. Now we talk more on the phone. I find—just as Wendell said—that we don’t have to explain things. We’ve got common interests.  But what’s interesting about those common interests is that while mine are informed by science, Wendell’s are informed by literature—which I’ve found absolutely indispensable and use all the time. For example, I recently talked about Milton and Blake in one of my public lectures. Shoot, I’d never have come to Milton and Blake on my own, ever. Or the title of my last book, <em>Consulting the Genius of the Place</em>, came from Wendell. Wendell’s literary engagement has enriched my whole way of thinking about the world. Early on in my friendship with Wendell, I found that if you have an abstraction without a particularity, you better pack your bags. But I came out of family that was like that. You know, rural people. They spoke plainly. That’s one thing I really liked about our relationship from the beginning—it’s quite all right to speak plainly.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> When we talk, we don’t sound like the Biology Department talking to the English Department.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Or biologists talking to biologists. In some respects, because we come from different disciplines, there’s a forced plainness in our talk that is just as communicative. Our common ground is <em>ground</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> That’s right. The common experience of growing up on the ground, doing the work of landed people: that’s a connection. It doesn’t require much explaining. I think you’d be mistaken, though, if you thought we always talk as if we are at a conference. There’s a lot of what more serious people would consider waste in our conversations but that for us is utterly enjoyable. Sometimes I call Wes because I haven’t heard from him for a long time, and I want to know how he is. I’ve begun to worry about him. I know he’s been traveling a lot. So I try to get him on the phone, and I don’t have any agenda at all. I just want to hear his voice and see what he’s found out and catch up a little bit. Some of these conversations are favored in a more serious way, and something will come up—a rabbit will jump, and we’ll chase it, and we’ll both learn something, or I’ll learn something from him. It’s just being available to each other that makes these possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> When I put out <em>New Roots for Agriculture</em>, I didn’t see this coming. I’d read <em>The Unsettling of America</em>. I was very taken with it. As I say in my book, <em>Consulting the Genius of the Place</em>, when Wendell called, I turned to the family and said, “It’s Wendell Berry.” I had no idea we’d have the kind of symmetry we have. If you start with the idea we’re all students trying to understand, then you forget about any game playing like you see in universities. In the university, you’re forever seeing people who bring up a book or article or something else they’ve done, and you feel terrible about yourself, thinking, “Oh, I’ll never do that.” But if you start with the idea there’s a deficiency that needs to be dealt with, as Wendell and I do, you get at it together. And that comes from friendship. Wendell has pulled that line out of E.M. Forester’s <em>Howard’s End</em>: “It all turns on affection, don’t you know.” Once you have that reality—it all turns on affection—then you don’t have a university. You’ve simply got a way of being with one another that’s enriching.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> Actually, this friendship didn’t start with my phone call to you. Gary Snyder had heard Wes speak at a conference, and he told me, “You have to talk to this guy Wes Jackson.” So somehow or another I got the book <em>New Roots for Agricultur</em>e. I heard about it, got it, read it, and wrote Wes, raising some issue about the horse/tractor issue. I didn’t have any evidence; I just had memories, anecdotal stuff, so I wrote him that I thought he was off on the number of horses necessary for a certain number of acres. Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> You pleaded with me to keep horses on the agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> I flew out to Salina, and Wes met me at the airport in this old car. Wes was buying his cars by the pound back then. We did not meet in an adversarial spirit. The spirit was immediately conversational. Talking for pleasure, in a way. However serious or productive this conversation might be, it has always been a pleasure. I was working at that time for Rodale Press—before they fired me for being more interested in the local than in organic. I called Wes and asked if I could write an article about The Land Institute. He invited me to visit, and of course I accepted. It wasn’t long after that until Wes was at my house with a bunch of &#8212;<ins cite="mailto:Lauren%20Zastrow" datetime="2012-04-07T14:00"></ins></p>
<p><strong>Jackson: &#8212; </strong><ins cite="mailto:Lauren%20Zastrow" datetime="2012-04-07T14:00"></ins>Eastern gamma grass roots.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> So it’s just gone that way. We’ve stayed in touch. This is the way intellectual life is supposed to go.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> There was a time in which I know I was trying to impress Wendell.  He had dropped out and left the university, and I had, too. Of course, I admired him, so the desire to impress him was sort of like courtship.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> Jesus, I didn’t know that. (laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Well, it’s like courtship with a woman. There reaches a point in the courtship in which you can relax. (laughter) That faded pretty fast. I know it was there for a couple months, or weeks, or whatever—but it didn’t last long.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~</p>
<p><strong>Streit Krug:</strong> I wonder if you might want to talk some about your decision to share your private friendship—your “courtship”—with a more public audience. In many ways you’ve written about your friendship and talked about it. What led you to take this private relationship and share some aspects of it with the public? In what way might it be important for friendships to be known? What work might they be able to do in the world?</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> With our friendship I don’t worry about being on guard. No one reveals every thought, of course; indeed, much of anyone’s thought would be uninteresting to others. Our friendship moves along in a fluid sort of way. If there is a rock that divides our stream of thought it never lasts.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> I wrote about my friendship with Wes in <em>Life is a Miracle</em>. The purpose there was to talk about the difference between a conversation—as a form of intellectual life—as opposed to the specialist departmentalism of the modern university. I had to show our friendship as an example because it was the only example I had. It is possible to talk across these disciplinary lines–</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> –on certain conditions and to certain advantages.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wendell-Wes-pix.jpg"><img title="Wendell &amp; Wes 2" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wendell-Wes-pix.jpg" alt="" width="496" height="282" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Streit Krug:</strong> The gift you’re able to give together, then, is this mutual search, showing other people how it might work. Do you reflect upon the legacy of your friendship? Has your friendship influenced what you understand to be a “good ancestor,” or what you want to give to others?</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> We don’t live our lives for posterity, though posterity has a certain claim on us, and I think we acknowledge and honor that. But when friends talk, they’re speaking as themselves, for themselves, and the generosity is taken care of, not by some explicit sense of obligation to posterity, but to the basic principles of honesty, good faith, the effort to be clear. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> One of Wendell’s most memorable sentences for me was his statement: “I just want to make sense.” This is very different from, “I want to go down in history.”</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> People ask me all the time how I think about my audience when I write. But readers can be a distraction. My obligation is to the subject. Posterity is not ever an audience—it’s an inheritor. To try to please posterity is presumptuous.  If I’m telling a story, my obligation is to the story. Or if I’m making an argument, my obligation is to the argument.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~</p>
<p><strong>Van Tassel:</strong> What have you learned about your own homes, your own places, from one another? Like how has your understanding, Wendell, of Kentucky been shaped or changed because of Wes? Or, Wes, how has your understanding of your home been changed by Wendell?</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> My metaphor for that would be binocular vision. I know Wes pretty well, and I know his mind pretty well, so when he comes to my place I can’t help imagining it the way it must appear to him.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> You can’t see back there; there are too many hills. (laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> You can see too far out here; it gives you a rather creepy feeling. (laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> I don’t think you can live anywhere you can’t see the curvature of the earth. (laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> You don’t know who may be looking. (laughter) I got Wes to come one time to travel with me and some friends in eastern Kentucky because I wanted him to see what’s going on up there with the coal mines. And it would be hard to classify or catalog the benefits of that. That’s something I don’t have to explain anymore. He sees.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> So your conversation gains a step there. It’s a step required by the laws of friendliness, of affection—of love, actually. To imagine what something that matters to you looks like to somebody else is a kind of discipline.</p>
