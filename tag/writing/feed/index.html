								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey friends of Flyway, read on below for some of our editor&#8217;s selected reads from around the web. Happy November!</p>
<p><a href="http://brevitymag.com/current-issue/choom/" target="_blank"> “Choom”</a> / by: Jenny Boully (nonfiction in <em>Brevity</em>)<br />
Through a concise and lyrical list of details about a woman, BaNoi, a child deciphers her bewildering life.</p>
<p>“Mother says she would not like to die in this country; she says that when she dies, if she should die here, please take her home; she does not like what they do to dead bodies in this country; she says she will need monks to help carry her home.”</p>
<p><a href="http://annalemma.net/features/hostages.html" target="_blank">“Hostages”</a> / by Shannon Heffernan (fiction in <em>Annalemma</em>)<br />
Twin sisters negotiate secrets and their evolving relationship amidst a hostage situation happening in a nearby apartment building.</p>
<p>“Karen sits back in the tub. For a second she seems like a stranger and I try to figure out if she’s beautiful or ugly. But I love her and hate her too much to know what either of us really looks like.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sixthfinch.com/hogan1.html" target="_blank"> “Of Belief in the Nonexistence in Worlds that are Not our Own” </a>and <a href="http://sixthfinch.com/hogan2.html" target="_blank">“Scenes from a Massacre”</a> / by John Fenlon Hogan (poetry in <em>Sixth Finch</em>)<br />
I don’t really know what to say about these poems except that, after reading them, I wanted to find and immediately read Hogan’s other work!</p>
<p>“And I have seen enough movies to know / that I don’t know the world is almost / ending often, and I know of no other way / to woo her than with a sense of too much / fate.”</p>
<p><a href="http://thejournalmag.org/archives/2122" target="_blank">“Anatomy”</a> / by: Valerie Wetlaufer (poetry in <em>The Journal</em>)<br />
Birds and the body. Gorgeous language. Even the form attempts flight right out of this poem.</p>
<p>“My best lines to you are composed on vellum, the skin of a stillborn lamb. / I scrape the hide clean, / remove the hairs and rub it smooth with pumice.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meet <strong>Lindsay Tigue,</strong> our Non-fiction editor with a love for all genres. She&#8217;s one to borrow a book from, if you&#8217;re in need.</p>
<div id="attachment_826" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ltigue3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-826" class="size-full wp-image-826" title="Lindsay Tigue, non-fiction editor" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ltigue3.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="338" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-826" class="wp-caption-text">Lindsay Tigue, non-fiction editor</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><br />
I already reviewed this on this blog over the summer, but <em>The Field Guide to Getting Lost </em>by Rebecca Solnit. I am <em>still</em> talking about it. It&#8217;s the kind of book where as soon as I put it down I needed to pick up another by the same author. More Solnit. I love her blend of historical and personal; the balance she achieves seems to me more fluid than a lot of nonfiction I come across.</p>
<p>As far as poetry, I cannot stop talking about <em>Words for Empty and Words for Full</em> by Bob Hicok. Not to sound hyperbolic, but I feel differently about words after reading these poems, particularly the ones about the Virginia Tech shootings. He seems to get away with so much with so little. I love that.</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><em><br />
Boys of My Youth</em> by Jo Ann Beard, <em>The Collected Stories</em> by Amy Hempel, A<em>t the Drive-In Volcano</em> by Aimee <em>Nezhukumatathil</em>, <em>Among the Missing</em> by Dan Chaon. Depending on what genre I am trying to write, these are the books I need to read and reread. Without fail, they make me want to try again. They all achieve something I really want to do.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I love <em>Third Coast</em>, <em>Ecotone</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, <em>Ninth Letter</em>, <em>Colorado Review</em>, <em>Black Warrior Review</em>, <em>Indiana Review</em>, <em>Sycamore Review</em>, <em>One Story</em>, and oh so many others.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t necessarily read literary magazines because I recognize a name. The fun is in the discovery—the heartrending essay, story, or poem by someone whom I&#8217;ve perhaps never run across before. That being said, I get excited when I see a literary magazine has a story by L. Annette Binder. I was first introduced to her work through literary magazines and I can&#8217;t wait to read her first collection, <em>Rise</em>, which was just published by Sarabande.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
At <em>Flyway</em>, our aesthetic centers around place and the environment and the essays that stand out to me are ones interpreting a confrontation or interaction with place in a surprising way. I also like essays that feel well-structured, but not contrived. I like essays where characters (including the narrator) emerge, essays where the characters become as important as the idea. There should also be some force driving the momentum of the piece, whether it&#8217;s suspense or some overarching desire or motivation that gets me to read on. I also hate to see disparaged “quiet essays,” or “quiet poems,” or “quiet stories,” as if words must to be loud to matter. I love calm human drama. I love tension. The subtle essay that doesn&#8217;t shout can often accumulate shocking power. And, really, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for; I want to be moved and surprised. Break my heart, contributors!</p>

		<title>Flyway Summer Reads: Lindsay D&#8217;Andrea on Patrick Somerville&#8217;s &#8220;The Universe in Miniature in Miniature&#8221;</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard the buzz about <a href="www.patricksomerville.com">Patrick Somerville</a>&#8216;s latest novel, <em>This Bright River</em>, but if you&#8217;re looking for something more on the &#8220;miniature&#8221; side this late into the summer reading season, first check out Somerville&#8217;s story collection, <em>The Universe in Miniature in Miniature </em>(Featherproof, 2010). Looking at the book&#8217;s spread (which boasts the ability to transform into a homemade mobile), you will wonder if the stories inside live up to the design&#8217;s promise of whimsy, scientific play and bizarre, slightly unhinged voice. And you will close the book satisfied. Each story combats the WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? of human life with even more insistent proclamation of what it means to be human in a time when no one can be too sure of the answers. The relief here is that Somerville&#8217;s characters never take themselves too seriously &#8212; or else they take themselves so seriously that the gravity of their voices give way into a truer kind of meaning. Throughout each piece, the world teeters on some unfathomable edge of an even more unfathomable universe, but the narrative ultimately survives.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780982580813-0"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.featherproof.com/Mambo/images/OUTSIDElayoutMOCK2.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a collection of voice-propelled short stories &#8212; from several pieces of flash fiction to the collection&#8217;s concluding novella &#8212; then Patrick Somerville&#8217;s <em>The Universe in Miniature in Miniature</em> is the summer read for you. Order the book (from Powell&#8217;s or another indie bookstore), read feverishly, and finish the experience with a cockamanie attempt at constructing the book&#8217;s solar system mobile. After all, why are books still around anyway, if not to cut along the dotted lines and add popsicle sticks, then string?</p>

<p>This summer, my reading list has consisted of a lot of nonfiction and short story collections. One book I really loved so far, was Rebecca Solnit’s <em>A Field Guide to Getting Lost</em> (Penguin Books, 2005). Solnit is a natural choice for readers of <em>Flyway</em> as her work often tackles themes of landscape and the environment. She weaves the personal with the historical so fluently and gracefully and her meandering between the lived world and the researched world feels genuine and unforced. In, <em>A Field Guide to Getting Lost</em>, Solnit explores the various ways people get “lost”and how losing can lead to discovery. Normally, this is the type of subject matter that would make me cringe, but Solnit’s collage of history and anecdote becomes poetic and delicately balanced.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em> </em>Hello readers and <em>Flyway</em> friends!</p>
<p>Hopefully everyone out there has been enjoying the summer and getting outside in the sun a bit. We are back from a short summer hiatus, bringing you an excellent new interview with Wendell Berry and Wes Jackson, by Kristin Van Tassel and Aubrey Streit Krug.</p>
<p>Keep checking back for upcoming Summer Reading Reviews by members of the new <em>Flyway</em> staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">OUR COMMON GROUND</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wendell-Wes-iii.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-699" title="Wendell &amp; Wes" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wendell-Wes-iii.jpg" alt="" width="518" height="242" /></a></p>
<p>Thirty-five years ago, Wendell Berry’s <em>The Unsettling of America</em> challenged agribusiness as the optimal model for farming in America, and since then Berry has been America’s most compelling advocate for ecological agrarianism. Around the same time, Wes Jackson was founding The Land Institute, a nonprofit organization where scientists are working to develop an agricultural system that mimics the ecosystem of the prairie, namely through the development of perennial grain cropping systems.</p>
<p>Over the course of three decades, these two world-renowned farmers–one a fiction writer and poet in Kentucky, the other a scientist in Kansas–have influenced, challenged, and entertained each other. Despite their very different training and approaches to exploring the world, their friendship has been a vital source of mutual creative inspiration. T<ins cite="mailto:Andrew%20Payton" datetime="2012-04-12T16:04"></ins>hrough the frequent exchange of letters and phone calls, they have developed new ideas and revised old ones, collaborating on a number of projects, most recently the essay “A 50-Year Farm Bill,” which appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> op-ed page. In an era of increasing abstraction and specialization, where personal connections are understood in terms of digital “networks,” Wendell Berry and Wes Jackson have instead forged a lasting friendship based upon their mutual respect for the earth.</p>
<p>Kristin Van Tassel and Aubrey Streit Krug interviewed the pair at Jackson&#8217;s home near The Land Institute, located a few miles south of Salina in Central Kansas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Van Tassel:</strong> You’ve written a lot about male friendship in your fiction, Wendell. But you’ve also mentioned in interviews that there are restraints on how men can show love and affection for one another, especially in public. So I wondered if you could talk about why this is the case for male friendship but also why male friendship is important. Do you see your friendship with Wes as extending beyond the boundaries of what’s typical for male friendship in intellectual circles or rural places?</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> I never thought to classify and label it as “male friendship.” My friendships have had their significance in being distinct, not in being alike. I don’t have much of anything to compare with this friendship. Wes is the only scientist with whom I have really talked over a long time. In some ways, I don’t think of him as a scientist but as a partner or co-worker, and also as a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Wendell’s ideas greatly influenced my thinking and therefore The Land Institute for three decades. Wendell’s education in the humanities having influenced the scientific discussion here shows what is possible for the universities; knowledge can be forced out of its categories.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> I’m enabled, too, in the opposite way because as a critic of agriculture, which I guess I am in a way, I’m necessarily a critic of science. I know most agricultural scientists are not going to respond to me because I can be safely ignored. Nevertheless, if I can get an idea past Wes, then I have a certain boldness to speak that I wouldn’t have otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Wendell has said to me many times, &#8220;All<ins cite="mailto:Lauren%20Zastrow" datetime="2012-04-07T13:58"></ins> adaptation is local.” This informs my idea of the ecological, and my ideas of the ecological have informed his idea of the local. This is the way it ought to be.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> When I say all adaptation is local, I’m talking about what I think is science. But if I didn’t have a scientist to say it to—who would either stop me or let me say it—I would not know. Maybe you could say we’ve given each other a kind of completeness neither of us would have had alone. There’s a kind of confidence that comes with this sort of alliance. You can think of it as a friendship from an internal point of view, but as it faces the world, it’s an alliance because we’ve got opponents out there. So we need each other for help.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Exactly. Wendell has said that in a conversation you have to respect the otherness of the other, and you don’t always get back the answer you want. But what you get back informs the next. If you have a friendship, you automatically have respect for the other. Now you can have a conversation. Think about how many conversations are unnecessarily combative. It becomes a competition rather than a mutual search. And that’s what it should be—a search.</p>

<p><strong>Van Tassel:</strong> How do you maintain your relationship? How often do you call one another or write? Is it something you just find yourself doing? Is it something you’ve committed to do?</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> Well, I call Wes to see if he’ll let me say something. I think of something with a scientific aspect to it, and I know I’ve got to call him up. I’ll say, “I’m going to say this—is that all right?” And he’ll say, “Yeah, go ahead and say that.” Or he’ll say, “Wait a minute.”</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> We used to write more. Now we talk more on the phone. I find—just as Wendell said—that we don’t have to explain things. We’ve got common interests.  But what’s interesting about those common interests is that while mine are informed by science, Wendell’s are informed by literature—which I’ve found absolutely indispensable and use all the time. For example, I recently talked about Milton and Blake in one of my public lectures. Shoot, I’d never have come to Milton and Blake on my own, ever. Or the title of my last book, <em>Consulting the Genius of the Place</em>, came from Wendell. Wendell’s literary engagement has enriched my whole way of thinking about the world. Early on in my friendship with Wendell, I found that if you have an abstraction without a particularity, you better pack your bags. But I came out of family that was like that. You know, rural people. They spoke plainly. That’s one thing I really liked about our relationship from the beginning—it’s quite all right to speak plainly.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> When we talk, we don’t sound like the Biology Department talking to the English Department.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Or biologists talking to biologists. In some respects, because we come from different disciplines, there’s a forced plainness in our talk that is just as communicative. Our common ground is <em>ground</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> That’s right. The common experience of growing up on the ground, doing the work of landed people: that’s a connection. It doesn’t require much explaining. I think you’d be mistaken, though, if you thought we always talk as if we are at a conference. There’s a lot of what more serious people would consider waste in our conversations but that for us is utterly enjoyable. Sometimes I call Wes because I haven’t heard from him for a long time, and I want to know how he is. I’ve begun to worry about him. I know he’s been traveling a lot. So I try to get him on the phone, and I don’t have any agenda at all. I just want to hear his voice and see what he’s found out and catch up a little bit. Some of these conversations are favored in a more serious way, and something will come up—a rabbit will jump, and we’ll chase it, and we’ll both learn something, or I’ll learn something from him. It’s just being available to each other that makes these possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> When I put out <em>New Roots for Agriculture</em>, I didn’t see this coming. I’d read <em>The Unsettling of America</em>. I was very taken with it. As I say in my book, <em>Consulting the Genius of the Place</em>, when Wendell called, I turned to the family and said, “It’s Wendell Berry.” I had no idea we’d have the kind of symmetry we have. If you start with the idea we’re all students trying to understand, then you forget about any game playing like you see in universities. In the university, you’re forever seeing people who bring up a book or article or something else they’ve done, and you feel terrible about yourself, thinking, “Oh, I’ll never do that.” But if you start with the idea there’s a deficiency that needs to be dealt with, as Wendell and I do, you get at it together. And that comes from friendship. Wendell has pulled that line out of E.M. Forester’s <em>Howard’s End</em>: “It all turns on affection, don’t you know.” Once you have that reality—it all turns on affection—then you don’t have a university. You’ve simply got a way of being with one another that’s enriching.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> Actually, this friendship didn’t start with my phone call to you. Gary Snyder had heard Wes speak at a conference, and he told me, “You have to talk to this guy Wes Jackson.” So somehow or another I got the book <em>New Roots for Agricultur</em>e. I heard about it, got it, read it, and wrote Wes, raising some issue about the horse/tractor issue. I didn’t have any evidence; I just had memories, anecdotal stuff, so I wrote him that I thought he was off on the number of horses necessary for a certain number of acres. Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> You pleaded with me to keep horses on the agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> I flew out to Salina, and Wes met me at the airport in this old car. Wes was buying his cars by the pound back then. We did not meet in an adversarial spirit. The spirit was immediately conversational. Talking for pleasure, in a way. However serious or productive this conversation might be, it has always been a pleasure. I was working at that time for Rodale Press—before they fired me for being more interested in the local than in organic. I called Wes and asked if I could write an article about The Land Institute. He invited me to visit, and of course I accepted. It wasn’t long after that until Wes was at my house with a bunch of &#8212;<ins cite="mailto:Lauren%20Zastrow" datetime="2012-04-07T14:00"></ins></p>
<p><strong>Jackson: &#8212; </strong><ins cite="mailto:Lauren%20Zastrow" datetime="2012-04-07T14:00"></ins>Eastern gamma grass roots.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> So it’s just gone that way. We’ve stayed in touch. This is the way intellectual life is supposed to go.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> There was a time in which I know I was trying to impress Wendell.  He had dropped out and left the university, and I had, too. Of course, I admired him, so the desire to impress him was sort of like courtship.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> Jesus, I didn’t know that. (laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Well, it’s like courtship with a woman. There reaches a point in the courtship in which you can relax. (laughter) That faded pretty fast. I know it was there for a couple months, or weeks, or whatever—but it didn’t last long.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~</p>
<p><strong>Streit Krug:</strong> I wonder if you might want to talk some about your decision to share your private friendship—your “courtship”—with a more public audience. In many ways you’ve written about your friendship and talked about it. What led you to take this private relationship and share some aspects of it with the public? In what way might it be important for friendships to be known? What work might they be able to do in the world?</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> With our friendship I don’t worry about being on guard. No one reveals every thought, of course; indeed, much of anyone’s thought would be uninteresting to others. Our friendship moves along in a fluid sort of way. If there is a rock that divides our stream of thought it never lasts.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> I wrote about my friendship with Wes in <em>Life is a Miracle</em>. The purpose there was to talk about the difference between a conversation—as a form of intellectual life—as opposed to the specialist departmentalism of the modern university. I had to show our friendship as an example because it was the only example I had. It is possible to talk across these disciplinary lines–</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> –on certain conditions and to certain advantages.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wendell-Wes-pix.jpg"><img title="Wendell &amp; Wes 2" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wendell-Wes-pix.jpg" alt="" width="496" height="282" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Streit Krug:</strong> The gift you’re able to give together, then, is this mutual search, showing other people how it might work. Do you reflect upon the legacy of your friendship? Has your friendship influenced what you understand to be a “good ancestor,” or what you want to give to others?</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> We don’t live our lives for posterity, though posterity has a certain claim on us, and I think we acknowledge and honor that. But when friends talk, they’re speaking as themselves, for themselves, and the generosity is taken care of, not by some explicit sense of obligation to posterity, but to the basic principles of honesty, good faith, the effort to be clear. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> One of Wendell’s most memorable sentences for me was his statement: “I just want to make sense.” This is very different from, “I want to go down in history.”</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> People ask me all the time how I think about my audience when I write. But readers can be a distraction. My obligation is to the subject. Posterity is not ever an audience—it’s an inheritor. To try to please posterity is presumptuous.  If I’m telling a story, my obligation is to the story. Or if I’m making an argument, my obligation is to the argument.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~</p>
<p><strong>Van Tassel:</strong> What have you learned about your own homes, your own places, from one another? Like how has your understanding, Wendell, of Kentucky been shaped or changed because of Wes? Or, Wes, how has your understanding of your home been changed by Wendell?</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> My metaphor for that would be binocular vision. I know Wes pretty well, and I know his mind pretty well, so when he comes to my place I can’t help imagining it the way it must appear to him.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> You can’t see back there; there are too many hills. (laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> You can see too far out here; it gives you a rather creepy feeling. (laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> I don’t think you can live anywhere you can’t see the curvature of the earth. (laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> You don’t know who may be looking. (laughter) I got Wes to come one time to travel with me and some friends in eastern Kentucky because I wanted him to see what’s going on up there with the coal mines. And it would be hard to classify or catalog the benefits of that. That’s something I don’t have to explain anymore. He sees.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>Berry:</strong> So your conversation gains a step there. It’s a step required by the laws of friendliness, of affection—of love, actually. To imagine what something that matters to you looks like to somebody else is a kind of discipline.</p>

<p>Born in Springfield, Missouri, Mr. Daniel Woodrell passed through the Marines, the University of Kansas, the Writer’s Workshop, and a Michener Fellowship, ultimately settling with his wife, novelist Katie Estill, in West Plains, in the Ozarks, the setting for so much of his fiction, a place called the “least governable region in America.”<img class="alignright" title="Daniel Woodrell,

<p>The <em>Chicago Tribune</em>’s review of <em>Winter’s Bone</em> described the prose as, “sentences that could be ancient carvings on a tree.”  Not some petunia-ringed slab of granite on Park Avenue or even Latin scrawl on the Declaration of Independence’s backside.  From his debut novel <em>Under the Bright Lights</em>, Mr. Woodrell rejected big city fiction and the stories of the landed class, a tradition he continues up to his most recent story collection, <em>The Outlaw Album</em>.</p>
<p>His writing is beautiful and sharp and lean with lines that snapped across my chest like the restraints on some demented log ride and then I was off, holding my breath at the sights, ready to take up arms with characters if called upon, lulled into contemplation by the moments just before the next swoop, eventually coming out on the other side knowing I was witness to something great.  Literary fiction without being about people who read literary fiction.</p>
<p>There’s this immense importance in Mr. Woodrell’s work, because it forces the acknowledgement that the lives in his stories, while fiction, are very true.  He gives these people, these Americans, a microphone and it’s our fortune to hear them, to see them struggle with getting it right.</p>
<p>What this all comes down to: The Dollys, the Shades, the addicts, and the Southern bushwackers—the outliers—can trust their stories are done justice when told by their bard.</p>
<p>-*-</p>
<p><strong>Logan Adams</strong>: Starting out with themes in your work—I’ve read some interviews where you bristle at people describing your work as “dark.”  Or maybe not bristle, but disagree with it.  Where do you think that misunderstanding comes from?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Woodrell</strong>: Well, I think I know in my own heart what I think I’m trying to say, and I think of my writing as having little sun breaks in it and so forth, but you really can’t argue if readers don’t see it.  I realize it and I’ve usually expressed that sentiment in a kind of baffled or bemused way more than an argumentative way.  I recognize it, and my wife also calls me dark.  [laughter]  And my editor would as well, so I just don’t think my books are negative, I don’t think they’re defeatist.  And I also think that one reason people think they’re dark is because they have negative endings.  But not all of them do.  You know, you have to make choices as you go through life and I think it’s just as useful a moral lesson to see what happens when you consistently make the wrong choices to show someone virtue triumphs.  So to me it’s moral.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: You once called “dark” as like life, life is dark.  That made a lot of sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: We can’t live in a cotton candy world where we’re not willing to recognize death—friends that have died, relatives are going to die, things are going to go wrong, jobs can be lost, houses are foreclosed.  You may have to save yourself a few times along the course of your life and all these challenges are things I think you need to be prepared for spiritually, not thinking that you’re somehow going to be the one to avoid that all.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Your family comes from the Ozarks and some are originally of French descent, and that’s where The Bayou Trilogy’s setting came from.  You’ve been determined to give people who are now your neighbors in the Ozarks a voice.  Why do you focus on the Ozarks and do you see your motivations for using a certain setting in other authors?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: I’m a huge fan of Faulkner of course, but also William Kennedy’s Albany<em> </em>books.  Especially the first half dozen.  Because in his own voice—and he probably had a lot of influence on my style—I was apeshit for Kennedy at one point.  [laughter]  Who had thought of the spiritual life of Albany before he started doing it?  I’d never read a book set in Albany.  I did not have this plan when I started.  I wrote <em>Give Us a Kiss</em> and it was kind of rolicky and I thought, okay I got that out and had fun with it.  I did not realize I would just continue down the path, and as I did I began to realize, this is your inheritance, this is your legacy.  I think a lot about where the people who settled the Ozarks, where they came from before then, in the United States and from abroad and think, yeah there’s a story that needs to be told.  Aimee [Nezhukumatathil] said, if I don’t say it, who’s going to say it?  I’ve said that many times about the things I write about and the things I hope to write about.  If I don’t tell it, who’s going to tell it?  There’s a French director I like a lot and one of his sayings is, make visible that which without you might never be seen.  I consider that a pretty good credo for approaching what I want to do.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: You just referenced Aimee on the panel and you both talked about the ethical obligations you both feel when writing about a place.  What obligations do you have to the people you write about, if any?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: To tell an honest story and to give it all you got.  I’ve had some complete books, I could’ve published them, but I didn’t.  I just threw them away, because I said it’s a disservice to the overall thing you’re trying to carry—to have an effort that you yourself don’t feel measures up.  I don’t think writers have to have that.  I’ve heard writers, Barry Hannah and others say, you have no requirement to do that.  If you want to do that it’s a good source of energy and drive to do your writing.  I definitely started out as a lefty—I had no politics when I went in the military, shortly after that I had all kinds of politics.  So I’ve always seen writing about poor people and stressful economic circumstances as having a vaguely political underpinning.  Anytime you show impoverished people as full humans, even if they’re horribly flawed humans, there’s a political component.  I’ve always felt this was a way for me to express myself about these people and to quietly have a political—not a Danny political platform—just a human thing.  And it’s also quietly a Christian thing, you know?  [laughter]  Most people don’t think that, but it is.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: I was going to ask you what your role as a writer is, but it sounds like you hit on it right now.  Is that what you see your role being?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: That’s the one I’ve chosen to adopt.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>:  How does your new collection, <em>The Outlaw Album</em>, fit into that role or that obligation toward the people of the Ozarks?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Well the stories are very stark and dark, but I was thinking in terms of murder ballads, hill country ballads, British Isles ballads, and folklore.  And there’s a Russian woman I like a lot—she didn’t really influence the writing of anything—but I’ve started reading her since I was done with this thing.  Lyudmila Petrushevskaya.  She writes little, short gnomic things that have a macabre air to them.  A couple of them have been in the <em>New Yorker</em>, I think.  And that informed this collection.  And also certain kinds of things—the story I’m going to read tonight, at the end of the reading.  For a long time I thought it was going to be a novel, then I actually realized it’s not going to be a novel, at least not now.  And realized it could say most of what I wanted to say in a short story.  So some of them came about that way.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: You spoke earlier about politics.  You write a lot about class.  There are great illustrations of Rene Shade being caught between classes in <em>The Bayou Trilogy</em> and you said <em>Tomato Red</em> was influenced by newspaper articles of lower class whites being killed and police not doing anything.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: A gay man was one of them, too.  And still not solved.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Has anyone been added to these outlier groups in the last five years?  Maybe framing this around your family from the Ozarks as being an example of social mobility over time.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: That’s what my new novel’s really about.  It looks like it’s about something else, but really it’s about how it took turmoil and heartbreak and tragedy to spring them forward, so to speak.  And I’m very excited about going to that road and I’m probably going to do it for a couple books, I think.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Focusing on the social mobility?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Well, yes.  One of the things I think about—I’m going to call it “working class,” although my grandmother who worked and everything, was probably more impoverished than certainly a plumber or something like that.  And then with my father we could say we had a working class household and neighborhood, but he did wear a white shirt to work because he was a salesman.  One of the things about moving up, my mother pushed us, she really pushed us to climb, and one brother did not, he did some time and some stuff and the other brother is an unusually successful businessman.  But as you move up and out of the class you were born into, you were comfortable with, you do leave something behind.  And Americans don’t like to acknowledge that that is part of the deal.  And some of it’s good and some are the things you value that you also leave behind.  There are a lot English writers who write about it very well—Allen Sillitoe and David Storey and those guys.  It’s kind of the thing, especially if you were upper middle class to begin with that you wouldn’t recognize—why would anybody feel a kind of sadness or loss to move out of a 600 square foot box with six people in it.  But you did.  I felt a tremendous confusion when my dad finally graduated college and got promoted and suddenly we weren’t living in the old neighborhood anymore.  We didn’t move up that far, but we did move out of there.  I think part of that is why I write so much about what I write about in my books is to recapture some of those feelings, that sense of neighborhood that which, even though it had all kinds of things wrong with it, you belonged, you felt completely at home there.  None of us were rich and few of us were incredibly poor—we were somewhere in that working range.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: The code that Rene [Shade] struggles with—the wonderful scenes in Tip’s bar where there are all these people sitting around thinking, oh, there’s the cop coming in.  Yet he feels a connection to those people.  He feels a part of Frogtown, but other people see him as the law and Tip has this ambivalent feeling toward him, especially in the beginning of <em>The Bayou Trilogy</em>, though it does evolve.  We see a similar kind of code that comes from a lack of interaction or suspicion toward the outside world in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, as well as in a lot of your other work, but particularly with the Dollys.  It’s really their code that allows that novel to happen.  What is the importance of these codes and how do you try to capture them and use them in your work?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Those codes make a lot of practical sense for those people choosing to lead that way of life.  The Scots and Irish were suspicious people when they first settled the Ozarks.  They didn’t want any sheriffs or anything.  They wanted no government.  That’s part of why the Ozarks developed the way it did.  It has been called the least governable section in America.  And not too long ago.  They didn’t want any of them and that’s why they left Kentucky and said let’s go where there is no civilization and we’ll just live there.  We won’t have order imposed because their experience with that world had been where order was governed by who had the gold and they didn’t have the gold.  They had religious principles, which I could have gotten into today a little bit, where your rightness with God was important, your material standing wasn’t.  It wasn’t laziness or anything—they didn’t see to pursing to every stinking dollar that’s available and that’s not necessarily what their God, as they understand him, would want.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: How do you set up your protagonists to navigate through this world?  Like Ree [Dolly]?  How important is the internal struggle of your characters?  Is this where your stories begin?  Is this what you’re trying to capture?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: I think it’s something more interior than that that’s not completely articulate to me.  But just as your speaking I realize that with Ree and Rene they have that same thing in common.  She’s part of a world she’s fairly ambivalent about and he’s a part of a world and he’s ambivalent in both directions.  What I wanted and one thing I think people like about <em>Winter’s Bone</em> is that it’s a story about a family with a code.  Might not be your code, but it’s a code.  A conservative writer who wrote a review about the book, he said, look, these people have a set of beliefs.  They’re not without beliefs.  It’s not your beliefs.  It’s not what you want to encourage, but they do have them.  It is a culture.  It is a community.  I think that’s one of the things people secretly respond to is that there’s this idea of being in a family where we understand a code and we have this bond with each other and that won’t be broken easily.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: I want to loop back to something you said on the panel that I haven’t read about you saying before.  You said you have a triple or quadruple vision of the Ozarks, so like in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, I wonder how much of this is why you pick up this “dark” label.  Particularly when these places are haunted.  Maybe that’s coming through in this triple or quadruple vision.  Like those contemplative moments where Ree’s reflecting on the stone fences and the ghosts of pioneers.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: When I occasionally get the feeling like I need to be somewhere else, I’ll tell my wife, look, I know my family’s stories, there’s a lot to feel good about, there’s a lot not to feel good about.  There was a lot of pain and poverty and uncles dying because they couldn’t buy medicine and all kinds of <em>Grapes of Wrath</em> kind of thing.  Those all happen there, too, and I said, I walked through this and it ain’t all hearts and flowers, I’m aware of that, too.  That’s all hanging there, too.  So that’s part of the legacy, also, this long struggle and not always triumphant.  Both sides of my family are from there and my mother’s family did substantially better than my father’s family—not hugely, but notably.  Their history’s full of murders and stabbings and one of them was a lawyer and one was a doctor and don’t get crossways with those guys.  [laughter]  And I said, I always find that kind of strange.  My father’s family was always in hard times, but there’s no known violence associated with them.  My mother’s family—her great-grandfather, I guess—was sheriff and his sons were raised comfortably on 1,500 acres and they lost it eventually, but one of them—and I use this in the book, it’s from family legacy—killed a guy in public and had to pay everybody.  But they’re full of violence.  Just full of violence.  It’s as if they had plenty and they just wanted more.  So, my dad I don’t think you could get him to shoot you—maybe if you attacked him. [laughter]  Whereas these guys who had plenty—and that’s one of these oddities of life, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: You’ve talked about spirituality as being this next outlier category you’re thinking about and I’ve heard you talk about some of the groups who have organized in the Ozarks because of this lack of nosiness, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Many of these counties are sparsely populated.  My county’s probably the most populous, but some of them are under 6,000 residents.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: So where do you think this is taking you?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: It’s going to take some development, because I’m not completely conversant with that approach to life.  The deeply spiritual, whether it’s a strange spirituality or not or devotion to a set of afterlife beliefs and everything else.  But I think that’s going to be a slow development.  I realized since just before I wrote <em>Winter’s Bone</em> that I was getting interested in this idea, because I’m aware of how the Catholic church co-opted a lot of pagan rites and adapted them.  I find that fascinating in and of itself.  That’s how some things got there because the pagans weren’t going to give them up.  [laughter]  And as I was saying earlier, I started getting into some of these unusual sects that exist throughout the Ozarks and I wonder how long they’ve existed.  They may go back to that revival in the early 1800s, I don’t know.  I’d sure be curious to find out.  It won’t be easy to.  I’m not great about talking to that crowd.  First off you almost have to declare yourself devoted to them to get a conversation, but I’m ready to poke around and ask some questions to see what I can find out, because I find it very, very interesting.  Even the crazy Phelps group we were talking about from Topeka—hateful, hateful people—they are rock solid.  They have a hard set of rules.  I saw a documentary about them and they excommunicate people for practically nothing.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Was that the one with the British journalist?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Yeah.  Doesn’t take much to get them to kick you out.  [laughter]</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Have a strict code, I suppose.  [laughter]</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Yeah, and you&#8217;re dead to them—son, daughter—once you’re out.  That’s a strange thing.  I found myself in a long conversation about the founding of Mormonism last week.  They had a guy that killed enemies of the church and there’s been books written about him.  And then I thought, well I don’t know, but then I thought, who are you kidding, what do you think the Knight Templar were?  [laughter]  At some remove the Presbyterians probably had one and the leftists.  [laughter]  It maybe have been some centuries ago.  [laughter]  And as Oral Hershiser said when he was criticized—he was the Tim Tebow of his day—Christian doesn’t mean wimp, people.  [laughter]</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Well thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: No problem, thank you.</p>

<p><strong>LT:</strong> In an interview with Christopher Mohar for <em>Fiction </em>&#8230;</p>]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, we posted <a href="http://www.flyway.org/2012/04/22/anthonydoerrinterview/">Part 1</a> of Flyway&#8217;s interview with <a href="http://www.AnthonyDoerr.com">Anthony Doerr</a>. Below, Flyway&#8217;s nonfiction editor, Lindsay Tigue, asks one of her favorite writers about research, authenticity, short-story length, and more.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> In an interview with Christopher Mohar for <em>Fiction Writers Review</em>, you said about research, “I very much use writing as an excuse to research, and research as an excuse to procrastinate. The world is so fundamentally interesting and it makes me fall in love with it a dozen times a day.” How much research goes into a typical story, or novel, and what types of “sources” do you seek out?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Right. Lindsay, do you do research for your work?</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> I love research.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Yeah, I love it, too. Often, my students kind of groan when I say, “Let’s talk about research.” They say, “We got into creative writing so we can make shit up!” But yes, for me, it really is an excuse to learn more about the world, to find some subject, whether it’s poisonous snails or sturgeon or the early construction of radios. In “The Hunter’s Wife,” I just got interested in hibernation, how animals’ heart rate slows way down. Do you call that dreaming? Do you even call that life? There’s this huge gray area between life and death. So often, I start by reading a lot about a subject with no real idea of how to build narrative up out of it except that I’m very interested in it. I think that’s the key for young writers—of whatever age, but young in their career—is to find those things that you’re vitally interested in, even if you don’t want to, or are unable to articulate why you’re interested in those things. Whether it’s violin-making or horse racing, or how dry cleaners work—the more you learn about it the more you realize, first, how ignorant you are and second, how interesting it is. Like that incinerator you showed me yesterday; I’ve never even really thought about an incinerator, what a job in an incinerator would be like. And how maybe in there, there’s some engineer who is probably really passionate about making garbage burning more efficient. And maybe there isn’t necessarily a story in that and you’ve spent a day learning about something you won’t be able to build characters out of.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> But you’ve still learned something.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Totally. In terms of a vehicle, the Internet is an incredible tool for procrastination, but it’s still an amazing tool for research—particularly for images. And you’re right, by the way, there’s a lot more research in a novel. Certainly, the longer the work, the more research there is, but being able to look at images, especially historical images in twelve seconds, it’s unparalleled. We have access to information like no humans have had before us.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> And videos, too.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> And videos, no question. For me, it helps looking at something like a Sears, Roebuck catalog from 1940. You can look at that stuff almost immediately. Maps, even Google Earth is sort of an incredible tool for writers.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> Sure, like do you turn left or right at this street?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> I do try to alienate the fewest number of readers possible, so I do try and get the streets right, the intersections right, even bus routes. I remember in my novel, I went back to Anchorage just to make sure that this character Winkler was riding the right buses at the right time. Some of that can qualify as procrastination, but you never know what you’re going to learn when you do that.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> You just want to make the true true.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> In that same interview, you said your “work comes from hundreds or thousands of hours of working through things, from pouring lots and lots of observation and thought into every paragraph, every dead-end, every false start.” I was just wondering, how long do you typically spend on a short story, for instance? A lot of your stories are quite long.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Yeah, the stories themselves are long. I don’t necessarily think of myself as a particularly slow writer, but I work a lot more than some of my friends do (laughs). I’m jealous of poets who are like, “My work day’s done; it’s 9:45a.m.!” I mean that in a funny way, not to dismiss the work they do.</p>
<p>The story, “Memory Wall”—which maybe is a novella—that took me around seven months of straight work. I had had knee surgery at the time and some of those days were ten-hour days where I wasn’t doing much else. So yes, lots of hours.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> Do they vary—do some stories come together more quickly than others?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Very occasionally. If I’m being really playful and I don’t feel like it’s going into a book, I can write a story in maybe two or three weeks. But those are typically two or three-thousand word pieces. Very, very rarely does it go that quickly. Even essays. Even book reviews. Book reviews end up taking me a whole week usually. A little essay for the <em>New York Times</em> that’s around eight hundred words—I’ll agree to do it because I’ll think, “Oh I can write that this weekend,” but it ends up taking me probably six days of work to do it.</p>
<p>I revise all the time. I’m just always reading through what I have and trying to make it better, and more musical, and cleaner. More true.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> Are you typically working on several projects at the same time or do you like to focus on one?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Usually multiple projects. It depends what sort of deadlines I’m under. This novel is probably now seven years in the making and I’ve written two whole books in between and lots and lots of different essays and magazine pieces. I think, eventually, to be a professional writer, you have to be able to juggle small and large-scale projects all at once. I like that today, maybe I’ll spend two hours on this and tomorrow, I’m in Iowa so who knows what I’ll get to? How about you?</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> I’m mostly just working on short stories and poems right now.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> But one at a time?</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> Yes, but I know I need to shift away from that.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> No, not necessarily. So you’ll have a story and you’ll finish it before you’ll start even a poem?</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> No, not with poetry, but I usually focus on one story that I’m really in because I have trouble breaking away from that cast of characters to work on another.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Yeah, that’s good. If you’re feeling the energy for any project you’re in, I think you just need to pursue that. That will change a little bit as you get toward your thesis and you start thinking about a book-length project. For me, it’s like once you start understanding what might fit between the covers of this book, you start trying to tailor everything so that it will all kind of mesh.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> So, for <em>Memory Wall</em>, did you know you wanted this thread of memory and time to appear throughout?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> I did, but it didn’t come until later. I had finished “Village 113” and I had finished “Procreate, Generate” and, I started to think—I was about halfway through “Memory Wall”—“If I start building a whole book out of this, how can I engineer all of these things to work in harmony?” In some ways a writer can be lucky because your fascinations align themselves subconsciously, so that it might still fit inside a book. But then, I started to try to overtly and consciously manipulate these stories so that they all revolved around similar questions. It began to feel as though memory was like a courtyard, and the stories all were windows, different kind of windows, into the same courtyard.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> And with <em>The Shell Collector</em>, was it the same process, or was that different?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Similar. I started some of those stories in graduate school and, after leaving, I tried to recognize which stories were weaker and pull those out and write stronger ones. You do start to ask yourself, as you generate new stories: How will this complement the other, already-completed pieces in the collection? That’s something I think about a lot. I think e-readers might eventually demolish the collection the way iTunes has demolished the album, but right now I do love the idea of <em>Dubliners</em> or <em>Winesburg, Ohio, </em>any book that<em> is</em> a collection, where it’s an experience to read each story in succession.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> They accumulate in a way.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Yeah, yeah. That’s a great verb for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> This is the typical interview question, but I was wondering what writers have influenced you? What contemporary writers are you excited about right now?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> No, that’s a good question. What contemporary writers are you excited about?</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> Well, I really like Jim Shepard.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> I love Jim. There’s a researcher.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> In Ben Percy’s class, we also just read Lauren Groff’s collection <em>Delicate, Edible, Birds</em> and I really liked that a lot. I’ve been reading a lot of debut collections, I suppose. I really liked Laura van den Berg’s <em>What the World Will Look Like When All the Water Leaves Us</em>.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Oh yeah, that’s great. She’s reaching readers. That’s exciting.</p>
<p>Let me see, living writers? I’m still kind of in love with Ondaatje. He has a new book that came out last year, <em>The Cat’s Table</em>. It’s beautiful; it just kind of fills you with hope that you can still be generating excellent work into your seventies.</p>
<p>I’m reading a book right now called <em>Solo</em> by Rana DasGupta. It’s gorgeous. Man, it’s really gorgeous. Really, it’s the whole twentieth century distilled inside one 100-year-old man’s life. He’s gone blind now and a huge proportion of it is threaded through memories, which I suppose makes sense for me, that I would like it. But it’s also got tons of chemistry in it and the second half is more of him thinking about these children he never had moving out into the world and imagining their lives. And you think that would be really nebulous, but it’s really beautiful writing.</p>
<p>Sebald—he’s dead, so it may not fit your question, but still a contemporary writer. <em>Rings of Saturn</em> and <em>Austerlitz</em>, which is such a beautiful book. In terms of the musicality of his language and blending this kind of curiosity and memory and imagination, those are things that have taught me so much just by reading him.</p>
<p>Andrea Barrett. She’s another writer who uses research really well and who really taught me how to use science, that you can be interested in science and write stories about it, that the science building and the English building don’t have to be four miles apart on campus. You can lead a life in which you’re interested in both things. She has been a real model to me.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> I think you’ve said before that you were really influenced by Alice Munro, too.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Yes. Especially when I was younger. In my early twenties, I started reading her and it was a weird thing to be a young man in his twenties and reading the kind of fiction that my mom would read, because it was often about the lives of women, older women in Canada. She has this reputation of being <em>the</em> classic living short story writer, but for me she was really experimental in the way she used time, really disruptive of the Ray Carver, Tobias Wolff stories that we had been reading and those the <em>New Yorker</em> was publishing. They were stories I loved also, but that often just took place in the course of one drive, one conversation, or one afternoon. I loved that Alice would try to encompass whole lives. Often she’d show this really important and powerful understanding of time, in terms of geologic time. That’s something I’m always trying to work with, you know, suggest that the lives of your characters are quite small in terms of the life of the place that they’re in without being preachy or making your work too sciencey so that readers fall out of it.</p>
<p><em>Moby Dick</em>, too. <em>Moby Dick</em> has been so important to me because there are all these chapters that are like: Here are how harpoons are made. My students usually say, “This is so boring!” but I like the idea that you can write this ripping, playful yarn and still teach your reader practical things about the world.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> This is related to my next questions. You write about science books for the <em>Boston Globe</em>. Have you always been interested in science? Have any of the topics you’ve written about served as inspiration for stories?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Yes. My mom was a science teacher and my oldest brother is a very accomplished optics scientist. So we were just surrounded by science. Growing up, our shelves were full of Aldo Leopold. The most literary books were Rachel Carson and Annie Dillard and even Rick Bass as I got older. I’ve just always been interested in the natural world and being outside and trying to understand it as a naturalist might.</p>
<p>And yeah, the column has fed my fiction in lots of different ways. The story, “Memory Wall,” the central conceit of it—which I didn’t arrive at until about halfway through—that memories could be harvested and stored, came out of a book I reviewed for the<em> Globe</em>. A neuroscientist was suggesting that that may be possible in the near future. Even then, I was like, “Really, should I try this? It seems so science fiction.” I read a lot of books about fossils, too. I read first about the gorgon in a book for the <em>Boston Globe</em>, this fossil that the characters are looking for in “Memory Wall.”</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> That’s great that your research is kind of built into your career.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> It is. It’s great. Even if nine of the ten books I read don’t necessarily filter into my fiction. The other nice thing about the column is that I get twenty books every month all about the latest issues in science in the mail. So it’s almost just the perfect job to keep your fiction growing. You always have more than you could possibly read anyway.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> So, at <em>Flyway</em> we’re concerned with environment and place in writing, and we kind of talked about the different settings for your stories, but I’m wondering, where does place come in your process, do you start with that first or do you start with a character?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Surprisingly not always first. It’s not always like, “Okay, I’m going to set a story in Tanzania and I can’t wait to see what’s going to happen.” Often, you have a character’s desire for something, or just some curiosity like we mentioned for a venomous snail, and then you start threading and spiraling different conflicts out of it and occasionally the whole thing will pivot to a different place maybe two months into the process. But you do need to obviously settle on your place before you’re, say, a fifth of the way through a story (laughs).</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> The MFA program here at Iowa State has a focus on environment, which allows students to explore interdisciplinary subjects relating to environmental subjects. We also read “environmental” writers in some classes and I was wondering how you would define an environmental writer, what that term really means to you?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> I don’t know how I would describe an environmental writer. I think it’s so important to understand where the comforts in your life come from and the costs that they have and how remote those things can be—you know, that your bowl of cereal did not just materialize and that the heat coming out of your furnace registers is fuel that is burning somewhere. That it’s our responsibility, not to feel guilty necessarily, but to try to comprehend our lives in context both with what the world’s going to look like in fifty years and what it looked like fifty years ago. I think storytelling can help do that.</p>
<p>I think there is room for morality in fiction writing and that’s something I grapple with all the time. I get frustrated when people say American writers are apolitical and American writers aren’t taking on moral issues the way writers of other nationalities might because I feel like that’s something I’m very concerned with, trying to display characters’ lives in the context of their times and maybe not judge them, but to just ask the reader questions about things like the Three Gorges Dam for example, in the story “Village 113.”  What does that thing mean to those villagers? Not to condemn it, but to show that it’s erasing centuries and centuries of history and question if progress is something that we should be worshipping all the time?</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> My last question: What is your favorite animal?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> My favorite animal. What I want to say is dog because I just love dogs, but that’s a little easy. Lately, I’ve been really interested in watching herons. You always think they’re very regal and grand, but when you start looking at them really closely they’re always kind of tattered and often they’ve got mud and snails on their feathers and they’re always probing around in mucky places. I think of them as deposed kings. Like tattered old royals who have gotten dirty somehow. I love their patience. They’re such a good lesson in patience. They can just stand there waiting, waiting, waiting for a riffle, looking for some little minnow to come past. There’s something amazing about that. I so rarely even eat without reading or doing something else that to think that eating is all you do. All day, this one thing, this one great project: feeding yourself. It’s a good reminder that we don’t always have to be rushing around.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In late February, <a href="http://www.anthonydoerr.com/">Anthony Doerr</a> came to Iowa State’s 8th Annual Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness, and the Creative Imagination. Doerr read from his newest collection <em>Memory Wall</em>. He is also the author of three other books: the story collection <em>The Shell Collector</em>, the novel <em>About Grace</em>, and the nonfiction account <em>Four Seasons in Rome</em>.</p>
<p>Anthony Doerr devotes his writing to the physical world and the miracles it provides. His nuanced observation deals in fascination—his characters’ obsessions become real in the worlds he constructs. Doerr’s writing spans times, examines memory, and takes on vastly different personae, but always, it inhabits an intense curiosity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Anthony_Doerr_web.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-670" title="Anthony_Doerr_web" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Anthony_Doerr_web.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="304" /></a>Doerr has received numerous prizes and accolades for his writing. He is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and two Pushcart Prizes. He won the 2010 Story Prize and the Rome Prize, and received the Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Award and the New York Public Library’s Young Lions Fiction Award.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em> blogger and Assistant Nonfiction Editor, Lindsay Tigue, spoke with Anthony Doerr about topics ranging from his writing process, to importance of place, and the possibilities of research.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Tigue:</strong> Your stories are set all over the globe from the Lamu Archipelago in “The Shell Collector,” Lithuania in “The River Nemunas,” to Tanzania in “Mkondo.” What draws you to writing about such diverse places, and would you say you are more interested in writing about the unfamiliar place as opposed to someplace closer to home? Or is it an equal fascination?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Doerr:</strong> That’s a good way to feed me the answer (laughs). I think I am more interested in the unfamiliar. All of my work has to do with disrupting habitual patterns, whether it’s at the sentence level in terms of disrupting cliché, or in the shapes of stories in terms of resisting easy structures, or in terms of place. I suppose I could read a great story about a bald guy who shops at the supermarket in Idaho, but that’s not the sort of story I want to write.  I’m drawn to reading because I want to learn about lives that are different than mine. Then you can also, of course, trace all sorts of commonalities between those lives and my own.</p>
<p>You know, when you read, more so than any other art form, you occupy the mind of somebody else and that’s what got me addicted to reading and writing. I’m drawn to different settings because I like to leave the familiar, no question. I think it’s easy to say, “Oh, they’re <em>exotic</em>,” and that kind of belittles the effort.</p>
<p>For me, I’m interested in transporting, too, in the way you disappear into books as a child. That’s what I want my stories to be—a place a reader can disappear into. And that hopefully they’re made carefully enough and plausibly enough that a reader will believe he or she is in this other world. Even if it’s not exactly an accurate, realistic version of Tanzania or Lithuania.  It’s as much a product of the imagination and research as time spent there.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> So have you been to all of the places that you write about?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> I have been to just about all of them. In my very first book, <em>The Shell Collector</em>, there’s a story called, “The Caretaker,” and the first twelve pages are in Liberia and I had never been there. In this most recent collection, <em>Memory Wall</em>, there’s a story called “Village 113” and I had been to Hong Kong, but I had never been to mainland China and the whole story is set along the Yangtze. So that’s probably the two examples of places I hadn’t been.</p>
<p>Already when you’re writing about a place you’ve only spent a month in or something, you’re a little bit nervous. I get pretty anxious when I’m setting something entirely in a place I haven’t been. In some ways, you’re liberated because the real world is so<em> real</em> and it fills you with detail that can often be extraneous. If you want to go write about New York City and you go stand in Union Square for a day, you’ll get so much detail that really doesn’t necessarily belong in a piece of writing where you’re trying to convey a certain mood or atmosphere or motivation.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> But it fascinates you so much that it’s hard to let go of, even if it doesn’t belong?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Totally. Exactly. I keep a journal and anytime I’m anywhere—right now, for example, I’m only in Iowa for forty hours—I’ll make as many entries as I can.  I never know what I might see here that maybe five years from now I can thread back into a story. I’m always looking at the journal as raw material for something that I might need someday.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> It seems many of your characters have a particular skill or a very focused fascination like the blind conchologist’s ability to identify cone shells, or the hunter’s wife’s ability to see the whole life of a person or animal through touch. So, I was wondering what draws you to characters with rare, or even supernatural gifts?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> In some ways that’s two separate questions. A lot of my characters do have specific real-world passions. In the novel I’ve been working on for a while, this boy is in love with radios and loves to build and tinker around with radios. But you’re right, other elements of my stories are supernatural and I get that question all the time and I never have a good answer for it. I don’t think of myself as a mystical person. I wrote a whole novel (<em>About Grace) </em>about a guy whose dreams occasionally predict the future, but I don’t necessarily believe such a thing is actually possible. And the letters I get from readers—</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> Oh gosh, I bet.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> (laughs) They’re like, “That happens to me!” I don’t necessarily believe in any of that stuff. In fact, I’m very skeptical of it. But I do love how supernatural events challenge people’s ability to believe. I mean, lots and lots of people right around us in this hotel lobby believe that two thousand years ago a dude was nailed to a cross and then put in a hole or a cave and got up three days later and walked around healing people. That is something that they build into part of every single day they’re on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> Without even thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Sometimes without recognizing the absurdity of it. But also, it’s kind of sweet and wonderful.</p>
<p>To a much sillier degree, I’m basically lying to my kids right now because they’re losing their teeth. They put a little piece of skeleton under their pillow and they honestly think that some little winged creature wants to give them money for that stuff (laughs).</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> And it’s so lovely that they think that.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Right. There’s something wonderful about it. I certainly don’t want to be the one to set them straight on the tooth fairy. Let the rest of the world destroy their innocence.</p>
<p>So you know, I am just interested in this type of belief. I’m trying not to make any judgments about it. I’m interested in putting characters in situations where everything they think is real falls into question in some way and they’re challenged. In “The River Nemunas,” which is not necessarily a supernatural story, I ask the reader and my character to consider: What if there was one last sturgeon in this river? What if they’re not all gone? Some people say that story is about faith and God and maybe that’s true; it was unintentional, or if it was, it was very subconscious. I just wanted to challenge the grandfather who thought he knew what his life was, what this river was, and to show him something that maybe upset his understanding of it. Or opened it up.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> In an interview with Christopher Mohar for <em>Fiction Writers Review</em>, you said about research, “I very much use writing as an excuse to research, and research as an excuse to procrastinate. The world is so fundamentally interesting and it makes me fall in love with it a dozen times a day.” How much research goes into a typical story, or novel, and what types of “sources” do you seek out?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Right. Lindsay, do you do research for your work?</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> I love research.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Yeah, I love it, too. Often, my students kind of groan when I say, “Let’s talk about research.” They say, “We got into creative writing so we can make shit up!” But yes, for me, it really is an excuse to learn more about the world, to find some subject, whether it’s poisonous snails or sturgeon or the early construction of radios. In “The Hunter’s Wife,” I just got interested in hibernation, how animals’ heart rate slows way down. Do you call that dreaming? Do you even call that life? There’s this huge gray area between life and death. So often, I start by reading a lot about a subject with no real idea of how to build narrative up out of it except that I’m very interested in it. I think that’s the key for young writers—of whatever age, but young in their career—is to find those things that you’re vitally interested in, even if you don’t want to, or are unable to articulate why you’re interested in those things. Whether it’s violin-making or horse racing, or how dry cleaners work—the more you learn about it the more you realize, first, how ignorant you are and second, how interesting it is. Like that incinerator you showed me yesterday; I’ve never even really thought about an incinerator, what a job in an incinerator would be like. And how maybe in there, there’s some engineer who is probably really passionate about making garbage burning more efficient. And maybe there isn’t necessarily a story in that and you’ve spent a day learning about something you won’t be able to build characters out of.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> But you’ve still learned something.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Totally. In terms of a vehicle, the Internet is an incredible tool for procrastination, but it’s still an amazing tool for research—particularly for images. And you’re right, by the way, there’s a lot more research in a novel. Certainly, the longer the work, the more research there is, but being able to look at images, especially historical images in twelve seconds, it’s unparalleled. We have access to information like no humans have had before us.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> And videos, too.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> And videos, no question. For me, it helps looking at something like a Sears, Roebuck catalog from 1940. You can look at that stuff almost immediately. Maps, even Google Earth is sort of an incredible tool for writers.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> Sure, like do you turn left or right at this street?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> I do try to alienate the fewest number of readers possible, so I do try and get the streets right, the intersections right, even bus routes. I remember in my novel, I went back to Anchorage just to make sure that this character Winkler was riding the right buses at the right time. Some of that can qualify as procrastination, but you never know what you’re going to learn when you do that.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> You just want to make the true true.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> In that same interview, you said your “work comes from hundreds or thousands of hours of working through things, from pouring lots and lots of observation and thought into every paragraph, every dead-end, every false start.” I was just wondering, how long do you typically spend on a short story, for instance? A lot of your stories are quite long.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Yeah, the stories themselves are long. I don’t necessarily think of myself as a particularly slow writer, but I work a lot more than some of my friends do (laughs). I’m jealous of poets who are like, “My work day’s done; it’s 9:45a.m.!” I mean that in a funny way, not to dismiss the work they do.</p>
<p>The story, “Memory Wall”—which maybe is a novella—that took me around seven months of straight work. I had had knee surgery at the time and some of those days were ten-hour days where I wasn’t doing much else. So yes, lots of hours.</p>
<p><strong>LT:</strong> Do they vary—do some stories come together more quickly than others?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> Very occasionally. If I’m being really playful and I don’t feel like it’s going into a book, I can write a story in maybe two or three weeks. But those are typically two or three-thousand word pieces. Very, very rarely does it go that quickly. Even essays. Even book reviews. Book reviews end up taking me a whole week usually. A little essay for the <em>New York Times</em> that’s around eight hundred words—I’ll agree to do it because I’ll think, “Oh I can write that this weekend,” but it ends up taking me probably six days of work to do it.</p>
<p>I revise all the time. I’m just always reading through what I have and trying to make it better, and more musical, and cleaner. More true.</p>
<p>.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past February, we Amesians were fortunate to have <a href="http://aimeenez.net/">Aimee Nezhukumatathil</a> read at our <a href="http://engl.iastate.edu/programs/creative_writing/mfa/">MFA program&#8217;s</a>  <a href="http://engl.iastate.edu/programs/creative_writing/mfa/visiting-writers-series/8th-annual-symposium-on-wildness-wilderness-and">8th Annual Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness, and the Creative Imagination</a>.  <em>Flyway</em> blogger and Assistant Poetry Editor Extraordinaire sat down to talk with Aimee:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/nez-biopic-200x200.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-655" title="Aimee Nezhukumatathil" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/nez-biopic-200x200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a>Aimee Nezhukumatathil writes my favorite kind of poetry. Her recent  collection <em>Lucky Fish</em> (2011) borrows language from the natural world   to explore the very intimate as well the very strange. Her poems are both  personal and universal, moving through space and time to celebrate and to wonder.</p>
<p>Before <em>Lucky Fish</em>, Aimee published <em>At the Drive-In Volcano</em> (2007), winner of the Balcones Prize, and <em>Miracle Fruit</em> (2003), winner of the Tupelo Press Prize, the <em>ForeWord Magazine</em> Book of the Year Award in poetry, and the Global Filipino Award. She teaches at the State University of New York-Fredonia, and lives with her husband and two sons.</p>
<p>Recently Aimee visited Iowa State as a guest at the 8<sup>th</sup> Annual Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness, and the Creative Imagination. Amidst all the excitement I got a chance to sit down with<em> </em>Aimee and discuss poetic process, growing up and gaining a sense of place in the world, and of course, deep sea creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Payton</strong>: We did a round table discussion in workshop of your recent collection <em>Lucky Fish</em> and we all really enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>Aimee Nezhukumatathil</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: So some of your poems are very intimate, while others, “Two Egg, Florida” for instance, are way outside of daily experience. What’s the most common spark for a poem? How does a poem form for you?</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: That’s a good question. I don’t know if there’s one set easy answer, but I can tell you probably the most common thing is that for me poems always start with an image. I’m always in envy of people that say, <em>Oh, I’ve got a great title for a poem</em>—for me it always starts with an image or a word that just sounds really beautiful in your mouth, you know? I just can’t get over it. Like the flower plumeria, I’ll be turning that around, but I don’t want to write about plumeria yet. So it’ll just be triggered by an image, but helped along by words I’m always tumbling along in my head. If that makes sense?</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: It does. Do you keep bank of words or a sort of reserve for when you’re having trouble getting something out?</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: I keep an image journal. It’s a whole mish-mash of things—recipes I want to try, things I want to jot down that I don’t know will ever be a poem but like the sound of. It’s almost like one of those old fashioned commonplace books where I write down quotes that I like or maybe a couple lines that I’ve been playing around while I’m loading the dishwasher or something. And then later, when I get time to write, I flip through and something usually will pop up from there. And I find if I don’t write it down, it will be just lost in the mind and out all of a sudden.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: You also experiment a lot with form. Do you impose forms on poems, or do the poems create form for you?</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: You know, I think probably a little of both. My first love is obviously free verse and that will never stop. But I’ve found lately that when I’m reading about things like teenage suicide… One of the teenage suicides from gay harassment happened less than half an hour away from where I live in Western New York. It was a fourteen-year-old boy who hung himself in his parents’ yard just because he was being bullied. I find when the subject matter is too painful, or you can’t even make sense of it in some ways, I’ve found that by using form it helps to make sense of it. In a way, I couldn’t find words for it in free verse. It’s been an interesting, kind of pleasant surprise in some ways because I always shied away from form. So with becoming pregnant, when things are just so out of control and you can’t really plan the next day how you’re going to feel and how the poem’s going to get to you or whatever, and being a mom—it sounds all cheesy, like now that I’m a mom I’m writing formal poems, that’s not it at all—but I’m just trying to find some sort of structure in a world that’s increasingly becoming unstructured.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: As we were looking at your book in class, we kept running into certain images—the penny, the fish. When you’re writing&#8211;</p>
<p>(pause and laugh, while University of Minnesota-Mankato gymnastics team cheers and screams in the hotel lobby)</p>
<p>&#8211;do you go through a collection with the idea to place these images into the poems? Or are they more like obsessions that you can’t get rid of?</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: I think it’s more of the latter. That’s really perceptive. I’m always in awe of people who say, <em>Oh, I’m writing this collection of whatever-themed poems.</em> I’m just writing poems. Eventually I’ll check to see if anything’s gelling. If not, keep going, keep going. It really just came out organically, these images of the fish, these images of luck or love embodied in the magic and surprise of finding a penny or something unsuspected. Those things always came up because they are a kind of reoccurring obsession. When I was forming and molding this into a collection, it was hard for me to avoid—another fish appears or another shiny object—it almost came about organically. By no means was I thinking themes or repeated motifs. Eventually I’d like to take on more of a project book with an overall thematic subject, maybe something historical in nature, but just not right now. It’s on the backburner. I love reading them; I just find them really hard to write.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: A lot of poems about the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: Yeah. Part of the reason I love poetry is that when I sit at the desk I never know what I’m going to write. For me that surprise and delight would be sort of taken away. I suppose you could have that still with an overall subject, but I even like that the subject is a surprise nine times out of ten. I never sit down and say, I’m going to write a funny poem or I’m going to write a birth poem. The subject comes out much later.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: Back to the obsession with images—are you obsessed with anything right now?</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: Yes. They permeated a little bit of <em>Lucky Fish</em>, but much more so now: deep sea creatures. I’m talking the really deep sea creatures, not just like dolphins, but the really deep stuff. I don’t know if you’ve been following this, but there have been recent photographs and recent expeditions to animals that have never been photographed before on the very bottom of the ocean—this is just in the last three months. Things like hairy crabs or crabs that seem like they have hair—they’re more like filaments, it’s not technically hair, otherwise they’d be a mammal and not a crab. They’re white and they’re furry and they’re called yeti crabs. This was just discovered four or five months ago, so I’m just obsessed. And that’s just what’s out there that we’ve gotten on film. It never ceases to amaze me. How much else is out there? What I’m working on right now is finding a way to capture that magic for children—it’s very difficult—but I’m working on poems that children can understand that give scientific and biological information about these animals to give a sense of what’s on the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>That’s what I’ve been obsessed with. The shapes and the textures. There’s no vocabulary for this. This stuff that is really uncharted and no one’s been writing about—at least not yet. It’s not like you can use the tried and true similes of a dolphin arcing in the water. There are movements and shapes that nobody even has similes and metaphors for yet. In a way, it’s kind of exciting, but it’s also kind of intimidating that you’re one of the few people that’s trying to tackle these subjects and trying to present them to the world in a literary form when there isn’t really a model for it. Do you even know what I’m talking about?</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: Well, I don’t know the crab specifically, but I’ve seen the <em>Planet Earth</em> episode.</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: Yeah, yeah, but even deeper than that. I could just sit and watch. Actually, that’s what my four-year-old was watching this morning when I checked on him. Some of them are a little—as he calls it—<em>scawy, vewy scawy</em>. You know, animals eating each other. But there’s a deep sea one that’s relatively benign and mystical with jellyfish just kind of floating around. So it’s an exciting challenge, but a challenge nonetheless, trying to fit these life forms into words and trying to translate them to the page when there aren’t a lot of models out there.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: That’s interesting. I often read about something that I want to write about, but it’s so far away from me that I don’t even have the language. Even things that do have language—something in another place…</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: So you use many images from the natural world, and you’re working on a book of nature essays. These images occur often in your poems. So how does nature shape you and your writing?</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: You know, I always say that with Nature with a capital ‘N’ is the greatest writer. I’m just trying to take notes as I observe it, trying to track it down before it disappears again. I think in some ways when dealing with these bitter subjects like deaths or break-ups or something like that, it’s almost the opposite problem—even with birth or love—I find that dipping into the language of nature and using metaphors from the natural world give a new spark or new energy. Rather than just, <em>Oh I love you,</em> or, <em>Oh, I’m sad you broke up with me</em>—those themes are definitely important and I don’t want to avoid them in my work—but finding ways to make them new I guess.</p>
<p>For me, incorporating metaphors with a natural bent always freshens it up. So even if I’m writing about first love, it still feels new to me if I’m using the medusa jellyfish as a metaphor for first love—for me, that’s exciting and new. I think it’s almost intertwined; it’s almost hard for me to divorce that because I watch so many of these documentaries and read so much. The majority of what I read is actually field guides or nonfiction nature books—it’s kind of my dirty secret—I read much more of that than I do actual poetry. So when it comes down [to it], when I’m actually composing, that vocabulary’s already embedded in me. So it’s hard for me to say I’m not going to write about nature, because that’s the thing that’s already been stirring around in my head. I feel like the natural world is full of metaphors that are very much applicable in 2012, just as much as they were in 1912.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: Our MFA program has a theme of tackling place in writing. As someone who has two parents from two different places, and not living where you grew up, how do you maintain a sense of place? And how does that inform your writing?</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: These are the best questions I’ve had, easily, in the last six months or so. Usually it’s like, Where’s your favorite place to write? What music do you listen to?</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: Those are important, too.</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: Those are great, those are great, but these are really meaty. Since this is <em>Flyway</em>—my Iowa connection is that I lived one year in a tiny town called Independence, Iowa, near Cedar Rapids where we’d go for shopping or something. My mother was a psychiatrist at one of the Iowa mental health state hospitals. I moved around and had kind of an unusual childhood, but wherever I lived the one constant was libraries and my father taking me around outside.</p>
<p>That’s something that I kind of lament a little bit. I can kind of see with some of my friends kids, this is a totally different world and totally different culture where the kids are inside looking at a screen. And I don’t want to sound like a curmudgeon, because I love my iPad and the technological advances, but if we wanted to have fun we would be outside. There was just no other way to it. TV was not really used as a babysitter for us, so we always had to be outside. Even if it was a place that we didn’t know exactly, that was part of the fun: to go tromping through backwater creeks in Independence, Iowa, or exploring the literal edges of desert in Phoenix, Arizona. Going back to that one constant of libraries, I could pick up a rock or pick up some plant and I was blessed with a dad who really knew his stuff. So he wouldn’t say, <em>Oh that’s just a flower</em>, he would say,<em> Oh that’s a yellow bell</em>. He would give me names at a very early age. So I was the annoying kid who could point out constellations, and not just say, <em>Oh look at the stars</em>, but, <em>Oh Orion is close to Venus right now</em>. Given that vocabulary at such an early age was absolutely crucial to finding a sense of place. If I was in Independence, Iowa, or Phoenix, Arizona, you could still see Orion—that was a constant. So even though the actual landscape we were in changed, there was a constant of the stars and there was a constant in going to the library to see what we actually saw outside today. It was an adventure.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, it was always presented with such excitement. <em>Oh look at this new landscape. We’re going to be in the middle of Kansas! How exciting! </em>And if we found it boring, our parents very much put the onus on us. <em>If you are bored, you are a boring person.</em> <em>How can you with your facilities and your imagination be bored?</em> In some ways they shamed us into having an imagination. I kind of liked that. And hopefully I try to instill that in my kids as well. I know sometimes I’ll have to give in and have the latest video game, but for as long I can fight it, it’s going to be up to them to make their own way in a landscape and be outside and find excitement from tromping around in the creek. There’s so much more imaginative play you can do there rather than staring at a screen and having the story brought out for you.</p>
<p>It was never presented as weird or unusual to me—I think I would have rebelled against that—it was just what my family did, and that’s all there was to it.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: You just brought up your kids. A common struggle for us grad students is finding the time to write with all other duties. So with teaching and having two kids, what’s your secret to chiseling away a bit of time to write?</p>
<p><strong>AN</strong>: If I had the one easy answer I’d be so rich right now. It would always drive me bonkers when I’d have visiting writers that would say, <em>Oh I wake up every morning at four and just do it.</em> I kind of laugh now in hindsight, thinking I had all the time in the world as a grad student, but I very much know the reality is when I was a grad student I was swamped. There were always deadlines; it’s just a different kind of being swamped. The only thing I can offer up is that wherever you are on this planet, if you find yourself attached to a partner or not attached to a partner, writing has got to be priority. If it is, you’ll find ways. It doesn’t have to be perfect. I think it’s that striving for perfection or routine, that’s where people falter. I like looking at it as, I feel better when I work out or I feel better when I have my favorite dessert. I’m not going to stop doing either of those things. I know I feel like a complete person when I am writing, but I also know I feel like a complete person when I’m hanging out playing Candy Land with my kids. I think it’s this weird external pressure—honestly it was drilled into me—wake up every day and write, or be a night owl and just always come to the desk. That’s all fun and great and definitely works for some people, but the big part of it is accepting it within yourself. I know that sounds weird and Zen, but if you do make that priority—you’ll have weeks you have to work on teaching or papers, but maybe the next week then. It’s when people don’t put it as priority, that’s when things go awry.</p>
<p>I didn’t really start getting publication success until I started having that sort of leeway with myself. There were definitely times when I did get up every morning and write—from eight to twelve, I had the luxury of a schedule in grad school, and write, and though not all of it was writing I was at the desk and it felt like a job to me. But so my normal natural self rebelled against it, so I wasn’t putting in the exact concentration. Everybody is going to be so different—that’s another thing I wish I heard in grad school—no one said, <em>What works for me may not work for you</em>. It was instead very much, <em>I have the key and you’re going to follow this pattern</em>. Somebody needs that discipline, but I think everybody can agree that you need to find a way where writing is going to fit in in your life and everything else will fall into place. There were times that I had have a three day break in between, now it’s almost a week, two week break in between because I travel, I teach, heaven forbid I want to be a good mom, a good friend, but I don’t beat myself up over it. Here’s the thing though: when I get to the desk, it’s on. No Facebook, no retail therapy. It’s concentration time. So I might have just two hours as opposed to my luxurious four hour block before, but that’s two hours when I am drafting and writing. That’s helped, too. There’s an urgency there that maybe wasn’t there before. Ultimately I’d say that whatever you can do to keep that urgency alive, so that when you’re sitting down at the desk, it’s happening. Go for it.</p>
