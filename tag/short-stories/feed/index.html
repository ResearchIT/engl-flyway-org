								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, readers! Know how to beat the dog days this summer? Seat yourself in your cave-like living room or chilly cubicle, sip on a crisp drink, and surf the Internet — or, surf <i>our</i> Internet, Flyway.org. We have some new content this July that will keep your eyes glued to the screen.</p>
<p>Most pressingly, the winning and second-place stories of our annual Sweet Corn Short Fiction Contest are featured right now on the site! Winner Mike Alberti’s piece “The Gully” introduces us to boys growing up the hard way in rural Colorado. Runner-up Laura Price Steele’s piece “Going It Alone” brings us into the world of a young woman at an intersection with mortality. Believe it, you do not want to miss these excellent stories.</p>
<p>But there’s a lot more you don’t want to miss in <i>Flyway</i> this publication cycle. We have bees, boas, and alligator gar in our fabulous new nonfiction — Alison Townsend’s “A Jar of Wisconsin Honey,” Daniel Hudon’s “The Recovery Plan for the Round Island Burrowing Boa (<i>Bolyeria multocarinata</i>),” and Mark Spitzer’s “Enter the Next Generation.” And we have Georgia O’Keefe, big cats, and ghost towns in our outstanding new poetry, and it’s all double or nothing — two poems by Jessica Jacobs, two poems by Michael Pontacoloni, and two poems by Justin Runge.</p>
<p>Last but never, ever least, you ought to take the time to contemplate our stunning new visual art, by Elizabeth Castaldo.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Fiction editor Lydia Melby reviews the latest collection by one of her favorite authors.</em></p>
<p>&#8211; * &#8211;</p>
<p>October is a time for stories about the uncanny, the unexpected, and the feared. The cooling air and paling daylight brings a sense of a thinning barrier, an atmosphere ripe for the appearance of signs to decode. And in his newest collection of short stories, <em>Stay Awake</em>, Dan Chaon gives us these stories, increasing the atmospheric pressure with each sentence, each blank section break, and we grow more and more uneasy as we read, and cannot stop.</p>
<p>In <em>Stay Awake, </em>children wake up   screaming. Parents fall asleep at the wheel. Men wake up choking, some with notes they aren’t sure they wrote, and can’t quite understand. Parents lean over their children in the dark, watching them sleep, reaching for them. Three girls sleep through their own attempted murder, and some day in the future, a girl will wake up with the memory of the presence of another inside her own mind, a voice that whispers “<em>I’m still awake.” </em>And she will wonder what it means, like the author writing, like us who read, they all wonder what it means.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to understand.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780345530370-0" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px none; margin: 2px 10px;" src="http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20120217-stay-awake.jpg.ece/BINARY/w620x413/STAY+AWAKE.jpg" alt="" width="191" height="289" /></a><br />
In “I Wake Up,” Rob describes his disorientation as “that sense of grasping, a foot coming down and not finding the ground.” It’s a sense we feel more and more as each story progresses, even worse because at first, we <em>can</em> find the ground, or so we think, as each story grows out of a heavy realism. These people are the sort of characters we expect from Chaon—the drifting, the tired, the quiet members of society who creep along in its outer edges. People who live in the wide, blank loneliness of the Midwest, who bag groceries or drive semis. These are characters who’ve all lost someone, often in ways we consciously dread, or have even seen.</p>
<p>Like the father in the title story, everyone is looking for some sort of answer. After a long struggle to conceive, Zach’s baby Rosalie is born with   two heads  joined at the crown, mirror-image faces, a “parasitic  twin” incapable of life without Rosalie’s body. <em>Why do people want to have babies? </em>Zach and his wife wonder, and as the answer approaches us, Chaon disconnects the narrative in a way that we read the whole story again, dreading that hint we’re sure we missed the first time around.</p>
<p>These stories, each told in the simple, melancholy prose we’ve come to love about Chaon’s work, mine that richness of possibility, that foreboding, not revealing what is waiting in the dark or on the other side of the door, looking at us through the window, but not fully in view. The best of these will cause a visceral reaction, a choking   feeling in your throat, something growing  in the back of your skull, “a flicker of consciousness would wink on and off.”</p>
<p>And as the answer approaches like in “Slowly We Open Our Eyes,” as “that awful, inevitable feeling…the ticking of a roulette wheel as the marble finally settles in place, ” Chaon cuts us off with our own, “Oh my God.”</p>
<p>This is not to say these stories leave us hanging. Many are well-written but predictable—<em>“</em>St. Dismas,” “The Bees,” “Long Expected, Always Delayed,” “Thinking of You in Your Time of Sorrow.”</p>
<p>Others give us answers that are there, eerily within our reach.</p>
<p>When Critter in <em>To Psychic Underworld:</em> loses his wife, he begins to find little notes—stickies in the library about cybersex, a frantic love letter on a dollar bill, a single, plaintive word on every napkin in a clean stack. The messages grow more pointed, more private, until the last is spoken directly into his mind as he nears an inevitable breaking point that we don’t see, but expect.</p>
<p>And his survival is a stronger possibility than perhaps the saddest of these characters— Brandon in <em>Patrick Lane, Flabbergasted</em>, a young man living alone in the same house his parents killed themselves in. His world is slowly shrinking, his living space confining itself to the humming fort of the electronics that circle his bed, shrinking just as irrevocably as the window for his escape. The end to this story is as final and definite as we don’t want it to be.</p>
<p>But it’s the final story, “The Farm. The Gold. The Lily White Hands.” that most evokes a sense of otherworldly, a feeling as if a person you were speaking to stared at something over your shoulder, and then   jumped. It’s the story I’ve read again and again, read aloud to myself and to unfortunate friends. It’s Chaon’s most experimental to date, and it’s the kind of story that will only exist once, a flawless sustained gasp. Chaon slowly, quietly, fills us first with sadness, then with dread, poured like a stream of cold, wet sand, bringing us the dreams we never wanted to admit we’d had, had and savored, and   remembered the next  morning  whenever it was we   woke up.</p>
<p>Because we do understand each other. We do understand.</p>
<p>And perhaps that’s why we jump, even though it’s the most commonplace thing in the world, when the wife waiting at our bedside looks up surprised, or the mother leaning over us in the dark touches our shoulder.</p>
<p><em>Oh</em>, she says. <em>You’re   awake</em></p>
<p>&#8211; * &#8211;</p>

		<title>Book Review: Send Me Work by Katherine Karlin</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Book Review: <em>Send Me Work</em> by Katherine Karlin<br />
by: Tegan Swanson</p>
<p>Katherine Karlin has worked in oil refineries, shipyards, print shops, and universities; and she sends the narrators of <em>Send Me Work</em>—almost exclusively female—into similar spaces. These women deal with an interplay of both contemporary social justice issues and ordinary, pedestrian conflicts, which Karlin navigates successfully when she refuses to rely on either for the stereotypical dramas they usually illicit.</p>
<p>In “Muscle Memory” the grief of a Hurricane Katrina widow and her daughter manifests not in funeral scenes, but in the cans of non-perishable food items the family has been stockpiling in a back closet. From the title story, which derives its name from the misheard lyrics of a Bruce Springsteen song, a woman spends the afternoon with a friend dying during the 1980s AIDS epidemic.  Rather than discuss his homophobic father or the Kaposi’s sarcomas consuming his body, the two friends discuss fashion and make jokes about the song lyrics.  Working on a fair-trade coffee plantation and surrounded by political instability in Nicaragua, an American in “Into the Blue Again” succumbs not to water-borne disease or violent revolutionaries, but a man who needs a personal trainer. These bends in detail or logic prevent both microcosm and macrocosm in Karlin’s literary worlds from becoming mundane, and they keep her off of a soapbox.</p>
<div id="attachment_771" style="width: 305px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.k-state.edu/english/people/alph/karlin.html" target="_blank"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-771" class=" wp-image-771  " title="K. Karlin" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/karlin.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="286" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-771" class="wp-caption-text">Author Katherine Karlin</p></div>
<p>Like the twists in subject matter, Karlin uses non-traditional structure to ensure that her stories reveal extraordinary facets of the everyday. The stories rarely take place in a closed-circuit loop, coming in and out of the lives of her characters sometime after the beginning, and usually far before the end. She echoes this episodic quality in the structure of “Seven Reasons,” a numbered, sectioned story which circles around a suicidal hobo and his approaching train. Issues like misogyny and poverty have no easy resolutions, and Karlin does not pretend otherwise, leaving her narrators at refineries, in rail yards, or wandering through Orthodox neighborhoods mid-struggle. Although this technique occasionally left me feeling pulled out of the narrative, having turned the page only to find that the story had ended already, in stories where the final moments still provide some closure for the arc of the narrative itself, these nebulous leaps out of scene succeed.</p>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/62-9780810152205-0" target="_blank"><img class=" " title="Cover" src="http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/Portals/0/images%5Ccovers%5C9780810152205.gif" alt="" width="300" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Send Me Work by Katherine Karlin, TriQuarterly Books (2011)</p></div>
<p>As a writer in a culture hell-bent on instant gratification, I feel a sauce-pot-on-the-low-burner, creeping-tension-in-my-chest-cavity, ear-drums-on-the-airplane kind of pressure whenever I sit down to start a new story. I feel its me versus the 24-hour information cycle, both of us barreling headlong toward an ever-shifting line drawn in digital sand between old news, and news worth knowing.  I want to bring stories to a meaningful life, one where characters act as mirrors of their surroundings, existing in an honest, often painfully, inevitable way; where specificities of place build an uncommon world contained not within 140 characters but within a few pages; where the ills of 21<sup>st</sup> century Earth have moved themselves in like clinging, unwanted house guests, all of them quietly disrupting the peace of everything around, no-holds-barred.  Each story is a struggle, my out-of-breath creative mind searching constantly for a viable, if not slightly wobbling, bridge to follow forward. I spend my time trying—and often failing—to leap from the just-finished past toward our genuine, ever-vanishing present, one paragraph at a time.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am masochistic as a reader, but I love to be made wildly, incomprehensibly jealous by writers whose work embodies these aspirational qualities, and in Katherine Karlin’s collection <em>Send Me Work</em>, I found many moments to be wildly, incomprehensibly jealous. These quiet, modest stories reveal strength in their troubled narrators without turning them into martyrs or damsels-in-distress.<em> </em>Both the true and scrambled lyrics of Springsteen’s “song about driving all night” lend their meaning as an adage appropriate for the collection. These women of Karlin’s stories are both searching for signs of resolution in struggle <em>and </em>moving steadily forward through the obstacles of lives lived always in conflict.</p>

		<title>Flyway Summer Reads: Lindsay D&#8217;Andrea on Patrick Somerville&#8217;s &#8220;The Universe in Miniature in Miniature&#8221;</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard the buzz about <a href="www.patricksomerville.com">Patrick Somerville</a>&#8216;s latest novel, <em>This Bright River</em>, but if you&#8217;re looking for something more on the &#8220;miniature&#8221; side this late into the summer reading season, first check out Somerville&#8217;s story collection, <em>The Universe in Miniature in Miniature </em>(Featherproof, 2010). Looking at the book&#8217;s spread (which boasts the ability to transform into a homemade mobile), you will wonder if the stories inside live up to the design&#8217;s promise of whimsy, scientific play and bizarre, slightly unhinged voice. And you will close the book satisfied. Each story combats the WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? of human life with even more insistent proclamation of what it means to be human in a time when no one can be too sure of the answers. The relief here is that Somerville&#8217;s characters never take themselves too seriously &#8212; or else they take themselves so seriously that the gravity of their voices give way into a truer kind of meaning. Throughout each piece, the world teeters on some unfathomable edge of an even more unfathomable universe, but the narrative ultimately survives.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780982580813-0"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.featherproof.com/Mambo/images/OUTSIDElayoutMOCK2.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a collection of voice-propelled short stories &#8212; from several pieces of flash fiction to the collection&#8217;s concluding novella &#8212; then Patrick Somerville&#8217;s <em>The Universe in Miniature in Miniature</em> is the summer read for you. Order the book (from Powell&#8217;s or another indie bookstore), read feverishly, and finish the experience with a cockamanie attempt at constructing the book&#8217;s solar system mobile. After all, why are books still around anyway, if not to cut along the dotted lines and add popsicle sticks, then string?</p>
