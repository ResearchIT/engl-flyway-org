								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The River Won’t Hold You</em></p>
<p>by Karin Gottshall</p>
<p>The Ohio State University Press, December 2014</p>
<p>Paperback or e-book: $16.95</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Review by Camille Meyers</p>
<p>An intimate and haunting collection of poetry, <em>The River Won’t Hold You</em> by Karin Gottshall explores the human experience of loneliness and connection with others. She writes in a quiet way, folding the reader in a warm blanket of words. From “Parochial:” “Was I a person who would / one day reach forty: a question I sometimes asked / the oven. Putting on my underwear every morning / (whales harpooned for the bones against the bones / of my great-grandmother, her own soft and lonely mother).” With such precise imagery and clarity of voice, it is no wonder that Gottshall’s second book won the 2013 <em>The Journal</em> Award in Poetry from The Ohio State University Press.</p>
<p>The opening poem “Forecast” sets the theme of the collection. A “sham fortune-teller sat / turning over cards, saying <em>you will be lonely</em>—” to the speaker who thinks “loneliness / is nothing more than a cotton slip // and uncombed hair” and invites it to begin. With this boldness, and perhaps naiveté, the reader enters the first section, stepping onto a path of poems winding through childhood and growing into womanhood. Gottshall avoids slipping into nostalgia or sugar coating youth. Instead her poems reflect growing pains, such as “Lesson,”</p>
<p>that tender purchase of dart in flesh</p>
<p>allowing him to reel her bleating back</p>
<p>along a taut line of animal pain</p>
<p>she couldn’t unfasten from—at some</p>
<p>point along that axis humming casual</p>
<p>violence (and his boy heat and her blood</p>
<p>just beginning to bubble under the barb),</p>
<p>a false idea she had about this world</p>
<p>and her position in it was corrected.</p>
<p>Often, a line break leads to a surprising turn adding layers of meaning. The poem “Translation” starts: “If I were tasked with inventing a language, / I would coin a term for the feeling of being called / by a different woman’s name. There’s another word / I wish existed, for the realization that it doesn’t / matter.” With this deftness of language, she gently writes about loneliness avoiding self-pity, depression, or glorification. This theme carries on through the second section even when the speaker is surrounded by other people or in the arms of a lover. A sense of seeking companionship or an understanding of self seeps into the poems, such as “More Lies,”</p>
<p>I like a place that’s lit by lamps. I like a place</p>
<p>where you can hear people talk about small things,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>like the difference between azure and cerulean,</p>
<p>and the price of tulips. It’s going down. I watched</p>
<p>someone who could be my sister walk in, shaking the rain</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>from her hair. I thought, even now florists are filling</p>
<p>their coolers with tulips, five dollars a bundle. All over</p>
<p>the city there are sisters. Any one of them could be mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ghosts dance in the margins of the book’s third section with poems like “Ghost Story,” “Tell your phone to stop calling me,” and “Afterlife.” Hints of death pepper the entire book, but the collection ends with an acceptance of mortality and that long ago forecasted loneliness. While most of Gottshall’s poetry is narrated in first person, “Listening to the Dead” makes a small departure:</p>
<p>“<em>I’ve come unstitched</em>, says the rabbit in the orchard, belly</p>
<p>torn open by dogs. <em>Maggots have come to sew me back</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>into earth</em>. All around, the softening apples</p>
<p>drop when the wind blows and at night deer approach</p>
<p>and lower their slender necks to eat.</p>
<p>Gottshall leaves the reader with haunting imagery, like showing tenderness to a shot buck in “Operative,” or stepping into a display of taxidermy wolves renewed to life in “Diorama,” “Or you step up, / into that stage-prop forest, under the colored arch // of the long-ago sky, and walk at last into your actual life.” <em>The River Won’t Hold You</em> takes that bold step, and with a clear voice and honest eyes, walks into the reader’s life.<br />

<p>Otherness: Flyway’s Asian American Special Issue</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em> reveals the “other” in identity, cross-cultural mishaps, food, and sense of place with this special Asian American issue. From the black and white photograph of Japanese-Americans departing for WWII internment camps, on the cover, to a white woman’s confusion in her Thai boyfriend’s family in “The Whitest Woman in America,” the writings in this collection reach beyond what it means to be Asian-American. Poems and stories in this issue reveal the collectivity of human experiences, exploring what it means to be human. The following are standout pieces of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction found in this issue:</p>
<p><span id="more-4396"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>“Minidoka, Idaho, Winter 1944,” a poem by former Iowa State University professor Neil Nakadate, recalls the double-standard of being “other,” as Japanese-Americans fought for the U.S. during WWII while their families were interned at relocation camps. The final two lines capture the heart of the poem: “Gold stars shine in the desert night,/ and dust settles on the windowpanes.” Another poem, “Backflips” by Charles Valle, portrays the duality and isolation of the speaker’s experience in tightly constructed tercets: “I learned from the laughter/ Simulated in sitcoms/ Just where to touch/ People and make them forget/ Just how foreign/ My first words were.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity in this issue is taken seriously by most writers, such as Nakadate and Valle. However, some writers approach the subject with sardonic wit. In “How the Lee Family Has Fun on a Friday Night,” San Franciscan poet Priscilla Lee juxtaposes stereotypes of Chinese families with Richard Simmons exercise tapes: “<em>Is this what Chinese people</em> / <em>do for a good time on a Friday night?</em> George asks, wondering what the hell/ happened to mahjong and opium dens.” Sarah Littlecrow-Russel’s poem “My Ancestor’s Supernatural Dating Service Fails” provides a portrait of multicultural confusion and role of women in relationships. The prose piece “Deflowering the Sampaguita” by M. Evelina Galang, further explores the confusion of love in the context of a God-fearing culture: “Here is how we come to learn of Jesus, Our Savior. Here is what they tell us. First Holy Communion. Like the first time you are with the man you love — but they don’t say that part.”</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Both of the previously described pieces and many others also present individuals in conflict with their families and family values.“The Whitest Woman in America” by Katherine Riegal is another example of family and cross-cultural misunderstanding, as the protagonist tries to fit in with her boyfriend Ira’s Thai mother and sisters. Many of the scenes center around the protagonist’s lack of knowledge about the Thai language, leaving her outside of the family dynamic: “Chin tastes a strawberry and says ‘Sweet!’ her highest praise for fruit. ‘Taste like,’ she pauses, ‘I don’t know the English word.’ Ira says ‘Monkut?’ ‘Yes, yes,’ she says, but when I ask Ira what monkut is, he says it doesn’t taste anything like strawberries.”</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Place and natural imagery also dominates the issue, from reflecting on places where family came from to the places the speakers of these writings live, work and love. In the lyrical poem “Mid-Autumn Moon” by Jeffery Thomas Leong, where the speaker’s acute observations and rhythmic pacing mimics ancient Chinese and Japanese poets in his reflection on his future marriage: “Just moonlight laying itself down upon/ the newly-opened earth, absorbing crimson in layered soil, finally grounded.”</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year marks twenty years for Flyway: Journal of Writing and Environment. We&#8217;ve grown a lot in the past two decades. Beginning with founding editor Steve Pett&#8217;s inaugural edition, which featured pulitzer-prizing wining author Jane Smiley, to today&#8217;s mobile webpages featuring content from emerging writers and artists such as 2014 Notes From the Field Winner Susannah Clark and paintings from Jake Ford.</p>
<p>Over the years we transitioned from a print journal to the current on-line format. Flyway also became a journal run exclusively by graduate students of Iowa State&#8217;s Creative Writing and Environment program.</p>
<p>For the next few weeks, our blog will post reviews of past editions and special republished work to celebrate Flyway&#8217;s past and heritage.</p>
<p>We’ll also be hosting a special tribute panel to Steve Pett at this year&#8217;s Association of Writers and Writing Program&#8217;s Annual Conference (AWP) held in Minneapolis. Visit our booth, which will feature our first edition, even a signed copy, among many of special editions (Asian American, Native American and Latino editions).</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy these reviews and republished works and let us know what you think!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Little, Brown and Company 2015</p>
<p>Hardback: $25</p>
<p>Reviewed by Meghann Hart</p>
<p>In late summer, the pale green honeydew becomes sweet, so sweet that many choose to enjoy its flesh in balls or canoe-like slices as a dessert. I opened <em>Honeydew</em>, not in summer, but in winter. This strange, rectangular melon was authored, not by a gardener, but by a contemporary master of the short story: Edith Pearlman. As I sat up in bed reading Pearlman’s latest gaggle of stories, all situated in the fictive Massachusetts city of Godolphin, a thick, nacreous juice began to drip from the pages and ooze down my wrists. Some might call this magic. I call it good writing. If you still don’t want to read this book, you should. Here are five reasons why:</p>
<p><span id="more-4371"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>Where Biology and Magic Meet</em></strong> You won’t see a deluge of flower petals falling from the sky in this collection. No, the corkscrews of narrative in <em>Honeydew</em> are all nakedly human ones. You will, however, be quick to spot the suprahuman peculiarities of the characters that people Pearlman’s world. Lyle, the teenage protagonist of “Wait and See,” does not perceive the world as other humans do. By sleight of DNA’s <em>mutatious</em> hand, he has inherited the capacity to see the world in many, many colors, an experience that lends daily life a multidimensionality far beyond the pale of standard human experience. When Lyle views a lemon, “he sees in the humble fruit….a tangle of hundreds of shades, ribbons of sunlight crushed into an egg.” <em>Trichromacy</em>, Pearlman calls it. In a world so overwhelmingly dominated by a dichromatic vision, how will the tender Lyle weather his unique gift?</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Witchy Women   </em></strong>In this world there exist women: your run-of-the-mill women, who work in hair salons and homeless shelters. They are the quiet ones who go about their work, say little, yet know much. People flock to these women, eager to pour their secrets into them. In form, these women are indeed women. In eye and in spirit, however, they are something else. There is something about the eyes, if you look closely, a dark and subtle gleam, like a window into outer space, or into the very bottom of a black hole. These are the women who make the world go round. Occasionally, you’ll see one bent over your yellow, mangled toenails—alternately, in Edith Pearlman’s work, they have names like Paige and Acelle—and you will see them often, if not everywhere.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Plant. </em></strong>If you read this book for no other reason, you should read it to meet and observe Plant. I don’t mean, here, to suggest that Plant is, in any way, human, but that this plant does indeed have a life and appearance all its own. As the charge of the charmingly off-kilter, Delliloesque Flaxbaum family of “Blessed Harry,” Plant flourishes in a dining room corner through steady infusions of mouthwash, fish flakes, and primrose extract. Plant is difficult to identify, as no listed genus-species pair seems to capture all that Plant is. Perhaps Plant is some rare variety of succulent, or perhaps plant has defied evolution and biology all together, and, in its agency, simply refuses to be defined by anyone.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Death Draws Closer </em></strong>For some, the lucky or not so lucky few, death happens all at once: a fall down the steps, a breaking of the neck, a quick cessation of the heart (preferably during sleep): other variations. For most, though, the real decline into death often has a clear, if not immediate, beginning. It is this steady yet inevitable decline, radiating out from an easily identifiable moment of transition towards death, that many humans fear, a phenomenon of contemporary post-industrial death that Pearlman captures well on several narrative occasions (i.e., the insidious curdling of a lover’s schlera, an individuated fall down a short flight of rather ordinary stairs).</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Sensitive Sensuality </em></strong>If you would like to read about some sex that is actually sexy, you might want to give Pearlman’s work a try. I don’t mean to say that Pearlman is some kind of master choreographer of sex, her characters glistening acrobats of the bedroom, but when sex happens (and it certainly does), the intense connectivity that exists between the characters is real. There is also a notable diversity of sex in this collection: old sex and young sex, married sex and unmarried sex, sex with power differentials, and sex without them. Perhaps Pearlman herself is suprahuman. Similar to the characters she writes about, her emotional and sensual intelligence seem to be off the charts, stunning—and particularly so when she writes about sex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To read <em>Honeydew</em> is to come away a little richer, a little better, a little smarter. In the final story, which shares the name of the book, Pearlman, through the voice of her bug-obsessed, anorexia-ridden character Emily, reveals to her audience the existence of a honeydew that doesn’t have anything in common with the melon, save its sweetness: “…Exodus describes…a fine frost on the ground with a taste like honey…it was really Coccidae excrement. Coccidae feed on the sap of plants. The sugary liquid rushes through the gut and out the anus…Nomads still eat it….It is called honeydew.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Poems by Dan Boehl</p>

<p>Reviewed by Ana Hurtado</p>
<p><em>Kings of the F**king Sea</em> is an adventure; it is visual art, poetry, and prose. The protagonist, an unnamed American man, enlists as the new crewmember of Kings of the F**king Sea, a pirate ship, and his poems are his preferred method of communication; they are uncanny and extraordinary. Dan Boehl, the author, and Jonathan Marshall, the artist, interweaved English, French, and Latin into a curated literary phenomenon. Through text and images, <em>Kings of the F**king Sea</em> playfully analyzes the roles of pirates in our contemporary world. Aside from poetry, the scattered bits of prose across this book create context. The art portfolio found in the middle of the book acts like gallery show, visually interpreting the book’s themes. As a whole, the book acts like an ongoing reflection of the effects of popular culture and global issues, such as Spiderman films and human trafficking, on what could be interpreted as a dystopian universe. Here are five reasons why I could not put this poetry/art book down:<span id="more-4288"></span></p>
<p><strong>PIRATES WITHOUT EYEPATCHES: </strong>The<em> Kings of the F**king Sea</em> crewmembers are not traditional pirates. They are artists; they paint, they grow their hair and beards, and they blur the lines between intelligence and lunacy. While exploring the world’s oceans and fighting arch enemy ships, these pirates bond with each other, confessing secrets, sharing illusions, and comparing disillusions; these pirates become jealous of each other, maniacs free at sea, fearful creatures, destructive elements of human nature trapped between waves and salt.</p>
<p><strong>THE MONSTER MEGAMOUTH AND ITS NICKNAME:</strong><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">“RUN TO YER GRAVE”</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> “Megamouth” is one of the bits of prose scattered across </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">Kings of the F**king Sea</em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">. These fragments act like diary entries in the journal of the man who volunteered to be a contemporary pirate. This particular fragment of prose features the narrator’s understanding of the ship’s captain, Jack Spice, and Spice’s fear of mythic forces. The following excerpt summarizes the key aspect of this passage: “The Atlantic isn’t a road, and the Hudson isn’t a byway. It’s not about the surface, or road, or the journey. It’s about not getting caught in Megamouth, whose breath is the afterbirth of the ocean, the place where man is severed from god.”</span></p>
<p><strong>YOUR HEART WILL DIE: </strong>I become emotionally compromised when I read the ship’s gunner, Mitchie Gitau, and his passage, “(Gitau)Early Sunday Morning”. Mitchie Gitau is a victim of the future, a survivor of a war, suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. The crew’s newest addition, the protagonist, finds comfort in retelling the gunner’s history: “… he’ll tell me his face was scarred by a faulty grenade, which also happens to be the way he was finally freed. He’s killed a lot of people, but he won’t say this. Rather, it’s a shame he wears on him like a Venetian blind, it depends on the time of day how dark he makes it.” Wow.</p>
<p><strong>ART AS A POEM: </strong>The visual components of <em>Kings of the F**king Sea</em> do not interrupt the book’s narrative. The works of art add layers to the explored themes and foreshadow the prose and poetry ahead. The drawing “Amputated Legs”, 2010, graphite on paper, features severed human legs and feet piled on top of each other. Smudged lines delineate the legs and feet; the hues of grey and tones of orange drip from the drawing paper, mimicking the wetness of watercolor and dripping down like rain.</p>
<p><strong>MARK ROTHKO IS A PIRATE: </strong>Throughout <em>Kings of the F**king Sea</em>, Boehl alludes to important historical figures of the art world. For instance, the “Cobra Sombrero”’s captain is named Mark Rothko. Both Mark Rothko and the King’s of the F**king Sea’s first mate, Robert Motherwell, are American artists who contributed to the Color Field movement, dating back to the 1940’s through the 1950’s. J. John’s, the shipwright, could be a reference to Jasper Johns, another well-known American painter; his work during the Neo-Dada period is transforming and exceptional.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite lines:</strong> &#8220;So maybe I have to lie/ to tell the truth/ like how we don&#8217;t need treasure/ we want what treasure represents.&#8221; These lines belong to the poem “Ship(Enlisting)”; the poem explains the unnamed American man’s psyche and reflects on his decision to join the Kings of the F**king Sea pirate ship.</p>

<p>Reviewed by Meghann Hart<i></i></p>
<p>In <i>City of Bohane</i>, the darkly brilliant first novel of Irish writer Kevin Berry, the reader is catapulted into a world of luridly shimmering debauchery, violence, and mirth. Bohane is a river city of brothels and shebeens ruled by the Fancy gang top-goon Logan Hartnett, a dapper albino, aged fifty, with a keen taste for calculated violence. For twenty-five years, ever since Logan the Long Fellow’s ascent to power and the official end of the Lost-time, Bohane has experienced an era of relative calm. However, as the year 2053 begins to cast its shadow, increasingly palpable forces, both internal and external, slink in the back alleys of Bohane, threatening to end the Calm, and with it, the ‘bino’s long rule. There’s no telling what might happen in this centuries-old Irish city, perforated to the bone by piss, blood, and bog air, but you’ll definitely want to sit your arse down and find out. Here are five reasons why:</p>
<p><b>Logan,  Macu, and the Gant: Love Triangle Divine</b> When  Logan’s old rival the Gant roles into town on the Bohane’s El train—not quite as sad as Gatsby, not nearly as regal as Odysseus—with twenty-five years of love smoldering in his heart and an intense hankering for the pre-Hartnett-Fancy past clouding up his mind like smoke from a dream pipe, you know that trouble’s about to get brewing in no fewer than a thousand dark, dank, and creviced Bohane places. Will the Gant’s appearance aggravate Logan’s old jealousies and continuing delusions of Macu’s infidelity to an intolerable fever pitch, or will Gant wander off into the Big Nothin&#8217;—the mysterious bog region that skirts the city—to wallow in the lost sweetnesses of his own sad history, alone? In the hands of Kevin Berry, King of Corkscrews, it’s hard to say.</p>
<p><b>Fucker Burke and Like Thugs </b>Names like Fucker Burke are particularly fun in that they make sentences, such as the following, literarily possible: “ ‘Like I know the fucking bogs from fuckology,’ Said Fucker.” Together, Fucker Burke and Wolfie Stanners are Logan Hartnett’s right-hand men. In their early teens, this duo lit many a hapless Bohane youth on fire. At seventeen, they have begun to realize whole new levels of viciousness, and they aren’t alone in their aspirations. Clad from head to toe in leather jumpsuits of varying shades is the beautifully malevolent Jennie Ching of the Ho Pee Ching Oh-Kay Koffee Shoppe. Berry renders these Fancy three with Tarantinoesque style, complete with lingering head-to-toe shots of cigarillo bedizened mouths, ass-kicking boots, and, of course, weapons. The young of Bohane may squabble to emulate these feral-eyed fashionistas, but only one young gangster will ascend to the Bohane throne.<span id="more-4081"></span><b></b></p>
<p><b>Darkest River of Lushest Lingo </b>So many current literary novels suffer from an extreme poverty of the surging, cut-the-mother-fucker loose kind of language that the avid reader longs for. Not so in Kevin Berry’s work. This writer has a river shooting straight out the tip of his pen. Much of <i>Bohane</i> is written in dialect that is distinctly Irish, yet other. Here’s a sample, courtesy, once more, of our friend Fucker: “If ye askin’ me,” said Fucker, “Logan H., he gone seriously fuckin’ para, like…But what’s this old Gant cunt gonna go and do on him? We got the juju over Logan, like? He’s well-protected, the Long Fella.”  This novel carries, in the crude integrity of its language, the quality that separates brilliant novels from lesser ones: spirit.<b></b></p>
<p><b>The City Itself </b> Bohane is not merely a figment of Berry’s very fecund imagination, but a culture, a map, a heartbeat—it is a place in the richest sense of that word.  In the business districts of Smoketown, Back Trace, and Newtown,“toosh” is sold, dream pipes are smoked, and meat is ground into Bohane’s favorite food: sausages.  Somewhere high above the sausage-making and whoring, amidst bluffs and clouds, loom the Northside Rises, where the “Norries” reside, seething with bitterness because the wind blows a bit too harsh in their part of town. A ways down from the Rises, to the left of the business district, stand the old, creaking manses of the Beauvista, the long-time home of Logan and other city elites. And on the margins of Bohane society, in the mysterious bog lands of the Big Nothin,’ live the “pikeys,” an old minority group of the region who loosely resemble the Roma. Among these culturally diverse districts, tensions have long been mounting. In a city so divided, who will conquer?<b></b></p>
<p><b>The Lost-time </b>According to its long-suffering inhabitants, Bohane hasn’t always been such a macabre mess. There exists a Lost-time that the old of the town speak of—a sweet time, in which the finest slices of apple pie that ever existed were pushed across bakery countertops, and black pudding was served up by the local butcher as black pudding should be served up. It is this time that draws the Gant back to Bohane after twenty-five years of exile. But there is a new era afoot in the city, an era of skin-tight leather suites and ass-kickin&#8217; stiletto boots, reminding Gant, and Logan, too, that all times—especially the good ones—must ultimately become lost. <b></b></p>
<p>My favorite lines of prose from <i>Bohane </i>are<i> </i>the first dark conjurings that make all else possible:  “Whatever’s wrong with us is coming in off that river. No argument: the taint of badness on the city’s air is a taint off that river. This is the Bohane river we’re talking about. A backwater surge, malevolent, it roars in off the Big Nothin’ wastes and the city was spawned by it and was named for it: city of Bohane.”</p>

<em>Departures</em><br />
By Philip C. Kolin</p>

Reviewed by Cathleen Chittenden Bascom</p>
<p>Peopled places are carefully wrought in the poems of <em>Departures</em> by Philip C. Kolin, Distinguished Professor at the University of Southern Mississippi. So often poems of place depict natural landscapes spared from, or void of, over-population. But in this volume, Kolin creates sacramental spaces where people are central. Kolin does paint for us un-peopled places: he lauds “Brave October on the Beach” where only gulls gather, and the soft midnight where the empress moon lingers in “Lunar equations.”<br />
The soft midnight velvet folds<br />
Into a cushion for the empress moon to linger<br />
In dalliance this first night of the solstice</p>
<p>Winnowing away her more faltering duties<br />
Of lighting the feeble and sallow-souled earth<br />
Whose breath barely sustains a season.</p>
<p>But the best poems in <em>Departures</em> carefully craft the bodies and souls of human beings in their contexts. A sacramental vision discovers spiritual reality in material form. This kind of sensibility stretches across these poems. They are not all about Southern places and peoples; we receive Chicago and Auschwitz too through the poet’s gaze. But the sacramental South is a focused subject. There are the sculpted couplets of “A Delta Christmas”; the tragic corruption of “The Slaver Superdome”; and the almost-Beat tourists’ prose poem “New Orleans, New Orleans”:<br />
They could not afford a trip to Europe. Instead, they settled<br />
on New Orleans. It had the graves, the monuments, the<br />
cuisine, the demi-denizens, the aroma of battlefields and<br />
bordellos, cobblestone poetry, the humidity of Africa…</p>
<p>Kolin portrays with concrete detail and spiritual alacrity slices of the southern United States.<br />
There is nothing saccharine-sweet in this body-soul quest. It seeks that which is transcendent in grit and grime, flesh and human frailty, and even taverns advertised by signs that blink “Yousay Beer.”<br />
Kolin’s people – often old, feeble and dying – nonetheless last. They endure. Through a fleeting glimpse of his piano teacher perched on a stool in a tavern:<br />
…one afternoon just to see<br />
How much evil lurked there.<br />
All I found was Miss Regina</p>
<p>my piano teacher who visited<br />
our apartment every Wednesday<br />
evening at seven for my private</p>
<p>lesson and stuck a silver star<br />
on my purple Scwann book.<br />
She sat on a high barstool, tall</p>
<p>Pilsner stein before her<br />
And a wingless angel<br />
Pinned to her frayed cloth coat.</p>
<p>He captures as well the unutterable spirit that animates “The Prayer Lady,” “The Secretary,” and even the twelve tribes of Israel who face “Passover in the Camps.”<br />
Well-versed and well-published on the plays of Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and Adrienne Kennedy, Kolin understands how a character is brought to life. Many of them wait in the wings for readers to encounter in the new collection <em>Departures</em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</em></p>
<p>by Elizabeth Kolbert</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Henry Holt $28</span></p>
<p>Reviewed by Taylor Brorby</p>
<p>According to the UN Environment Programme, “Earth is in the midst of a mass extinction of life. Scientists estimate that 150-200 species of plant, insect, bird and mammal become extinct every 24 hours. This is nearly 1,000 times the ‘natural’ or ‘background’ rate and, say many biologists, is greater than anything the world has experienced since the vanishing of the dinosaurs nearly 65 million years ago.” In <em>The Sixth Extinction</em>, Elizabeth Kolbert (<em>Field Notes from a Catastrophe, The Prophet of Love</em>) highlights the intricacies of what scientists are most recently labeling the sixth great extinction of many of Earth’s species.</p>
<p>Kolbert is, perhaps, the history or biology teacher you and I never had, one that uses exacting prose and luscious imagery to forward a narrative. Listen to the opening line of Prologue: “Beginnings, it’s said, are apt to be shadowy.” There’s lyricism, wit, and tension, which Kolbert continues throughout the book. She goes on, “So it is with this story, which starts with the emergence of a new species maybe two hundred thousand years go.” Kolbert highlights that, unlike the previous five mass extinctions, this one is wholly brought about because of one species: Humans.</p>
<p>The structure of <em>The Sixth Extinction</em> is thirteen chapters, each of which highlights an already extinct species, such as the great auk (<em>Pinguinus impennis</em>), or a species that is now known as “extinct in the wild,” such as the golden frog (<em>Atelopus zeteki</em>). The effectiveness of <em>The Sixth Extinction</em> is not so much that Kolbert focuses on the macro (all the species that are in peril), but draws a thread through the micro-examination of individual species, linking humans’ far-reaching overconsumption of natural resources and fossil fuels, contributing to the rapid acceleration of species loss.</p>
<p>Kolbert’s writing is luminous, balanced, and vivid. As a staff writer for the <em>New Yorker</em> her work has typically focused around the environment and disaster-related issues. The genius of Kolbert is her ability to bring heady scientific research into economic prose, guiding the reader and helping shed new light on the complexities of global warming: “But global warming is going to have just as great an impact — indeed, according to Silman, an even greater impact — in the tropics. The reasons for this are somewhat more complicated, but they start with the fact the tropics are where most species actually live.” (Miles Silman is a forest ecologist who teaches at Wake Forest University.)</p>
<p>For writers struggling with introductory paragraphs, here’s a zinger from the chapter “The Madness Gene”: “The Neander Valley, or, in German, Das Neandertal, lies about twenty miles north of Cologne, along a fold in the Düssel River, a sleepy tributary of the Rhine. For most of its existence, the valley was lined with limestone cliffs, and it was in a cave in the face of one of these cliffs that, in 1856, the bones were discovered that gave the world the Neanderthal.”</p>
<p>Perhaps best of all — if there is a good qualifier for the reality of a warming and changing planet — is that a writer such as Elizabeth Kolbert exists and writes for the reading public. She weaves narrative, vivid detail, and scientific intricacies seamlessly into her sentences, creating a compelling argument for our systematic destruction of the world. If you haven’t read <em>The Sixth Extinction</em> yet, get a copy — because, as Kolbert highlights, we might not be around that much longer.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>The Big Ratchet</i></p>
<p>Ruth DeFries</p>
<p>Basic Books</p>
<p>Hardcover: $27.99</p>
<p>Reviewed by Adam Wright</p>
<p>In <i>The Big Ratchet, </i>MacArthur Genius Fellow Ruth DeFries explores the ramifications of humanity’s ever-growing monopoly on the natural world. Part textbook, part historical narrative, and part philosophical conjecture, the book traces the progression of agriculture and urbanization from prehistory into modern times. Unfortunately, the book can’t quite decide what it wants to be, and it suffers most when dwelling too long on scientific jargon about the likes of phosphorous depletion and leaf-cutter ants. However, though <i>The Big Ratchet </i>starts slow, its last few chapters conjure a poetic ode to the rapid evolution of our species. Here are five reasons to read:</p>
<p><b></b><b>“Ratchet, Hatchet, Pivot”:</b> Throughout the book, DeFries uses this phrase as a metaphor for the social and scientific breakthroughs that have contributed to our modern lifestyle. The titular “Big Ratchet” refers to the Twentieth Century, an era of swift progress in which worldwide population rose from 2 billion to more than 6 billion. Though the sustained use of the metaphor can be grating, it often proves to be powerful, but perhaps a more apt title would have been…</p>
<p><b><i></i></b><b><i>The Secret History of Agriculture</i></b><b>:</b> This is really a narrative about humanity’s never-ending pursuit for food. The first-half of the book examines agriculture from a scientific perspective, while the second-half depicts the major agricultural milestones of the past 150 years: “Just as the pivot to chemical fertilizers would not have been possible without coal for factories and oil for machinery, the genetic twists to breed dwarf plants and vigorous hybrid seeds would not have been possible without chemical fertilizers and irrigated fields.”</p>
<p><b></b><b>Chemicals Kill:</b> The brilliantly-named “Competition for the Bounty” serves as the book’s standout chapter. Covering the history of modern pesticides, DeFries weaves together tales of post-war America, locust plagues, and DDT. The author wisely pays homage to Rachel Carson’s influential classic, <i>Silent Spring,</i> providing interesting factoids such as that the president of Monsanto once called Carson “a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature.”</p>
<p><b></b><b>Pictures Aren’t Just for Children’s Books:</b> Each of the book’s ten chapters is accompanied by a set of black and white illustrations. Some pictures highlight scientific facts in ways that the prose can’t — a chart depicting Gregor Mendel’s famous pea experiment is particularly effective. Though other images seem like superfluous add-ons, they still add a sense of wonder and whimsy to an otherwise serious text.</p>
<p><b></b><b>Our Unknown Future: </b>For better or worse, DeFries offers no clear answer for what our future might look like. However, her ability to describe the consequences of modern agriculture is simultaneously beautiful and haunting: “What is clear is that the Big Ratchet is as transformative as any event our species has ever seen. From the vantage point of the far side of the Big Ratchet, we can see we are a fundamentally different species than we were before the pivots of the past century came into play. We are an urban species fed from a manipulated nature.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Mastering the Art of Soviet Cooking: A Memoir of Food &amp; Longing </i><br />
by Anya Von Bremzen</p>
<p>B\D\W\Y Broadway Books<br />
Hardcover: $16.79<br />
Paperback: $10.88</p>
<p>Reviewed by Kristen Daily</p>
<p>Renowned food writer Anya Von Bremzen’s <i>Mastering the Art of Soviet Cooking</i> is much more than a collection of recipes for authentic borscht and the infamous mayonnaise-smothered Russian salad — salat Olivier — found at buffets around the globe. In this culinary memoir, or “foodoir,” Von Bremzen artfully weaves together the history of her family’s table in the Soviet Union, childhood misadventures in eating, and post-revolutionary Russian history with her and her mother’s attempts to recreate meals for each decade of Soviet history, from the last Czar to Putin’s Russia.</p>
<p>Some of the book’s most striking themes and anecdotes:</p>
<p>• The “poisoned Madeline” effect. Von Bremzen references Proust’s involuntary memory in describing the bittersweet nostalgia of food in the Soviet Union, where almost all food was produced and distributed by the state. Von Bremzen recounts the moral dilemma of eating chocolates served at her private kindergarten, chocolates that were manufactured only for party elites: &#8220;I remember my absolute shame and dread for wanting to eat these chocolates, and being afraid that my mother would condemn me. And I would eat it, and then I would just feel terrible….I felt that I was ingesting ideology with the chocolate — the ideology of the party.&#8221;</p>
<p>• The tension between the desire to resist and the very real need to eat. This tension comes across as a unique sense of longing, a delicate line between tragedy and comedy. While it is easy to get lost in Von Bremzen’s stories, especially the magical stories of her childhood black market career, the reader must also face the harsh reality of the Soviet Union — ration cards, breadlines, wartime starvation, and food shortages.</p>
<p>• The cramped kitchen of the communal apartment Von Bremzen lived in as a child, a “microcosm of Soviet Society.” Von Bremzen writes, “It&#8217;s this long vanished institution where all kinds of people were thrown together…a dissident next to an informer, a Jewish family next to an anti-semitic family. … And everyone came together in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>• Von Bremzen’s masterful management of time. She mixes anecdotes, family history, and flash forwards in her narrative as she and her mother cook their way through Soviet history. “Together we’d embark on a yearlong journey unlike any other,” Von Bremzen writes, “eating and cooking our way through decade after decade of Soviet life, using her kitchen and dining room as a time machine and an incubator of memories.” Often in food memoirs, recipes come at the end of a chapter, but Von Bremzen chooses to leave the recipes until the end of her book, allowing her to focus on the narrative, the preparation and savoring of each dish she and her mother cook.</p>
<p>• The food. For their farewell to the czars, Anya and her mother make Kulebiaka, a mix of fish, rice, and wild mushrooms in pastry. A tower of sweet, golden, butter-kissed dough, this recipe is a laborious undertaking. In her recipe, Von Bremzen notes, “sour cream in the yeast dough (Mom’s special touch) adds a lovely tang to the buttery casing.”</p>
<p>I won’t lie: As a vegetarian, recipes with meat do not often tempt me, but Von Bremzen’s delicious descriptions and the heartfelt narrative behind each dish had me salivating.</p>
