								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year marks twenty years for Flyway: Journal of Writing and Environment. We&#8217;ve grown a lot in the past two decades. Beginning with founding editor Steve Pett&#8217;s inaugural edition, which featured pulitzer-prizing wining author Jane Smiley, to today&#8217;s mobile webpages featuring content from emerging writers and artists such as 2014 Notes From the Field Winner Susannah Clark and paintings from Jake Ford.</p>
<p>Over the years we transitioned from a print journal to the current on-line format. Flyway also became a journal run exclusively by graduate students of Iowa State&#8217;s Creative Writing and Environment program.</p>
<p>For the next few weeks, our blog will post reviews of past editions and special republished work to celebrate Flyway&#8217;s past and heritage.</p>
<p>We’ll also be hosting a special tribute panel to Steve Pett at this year&#8217;s Association of Writers and Writing Program&#8217;s Annual Conference (AWP) held in Minneapolis. Visit our booth, which will feature our first edition, even a signed copy, among many of special editions (Asian American, Native American and Latino editions).</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy these reviews and republished works and let us know what you think!</p>
