								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Review and Republishing of Todd Davis&#8217;s Poems: &#8220;Learning to Read&#8221; Vol 9.1 and &#8220;Some Heaven&#8221;Volume 8.1/8.2 Spring /Fall 2003</p>
<p>by Erin Schmiel</p>
<p>I love how easily Todd Davis expresses themes of spirituality in his quiet nature poems. He says, in &#8220;Learning to Read,”: “I understand that learning to read,/like so much of life, is about faith and doubt —/the possibility of one, the heaviness of the other.&#8221; In just three narrative stanzas we see the progression from the oblivion of the 5 year old narrator: &#8220;my joy when you told me/I was driving, too young to realize you held /the wheel&#8221;, to the responsibility of road markers: &#8220;signs /sprouted like goldenrod and Queen Anne&#8217;s lace, and you/demanded I read them, pretending not to know/what to do if I didn&#8217;t.&#8221; The final stanza carries the reader forward from this scene and out into the world knowing that what has been said is as true for them as it was for the father and son.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Some Heaven&#8221; the narrator is a father watching his child pray for &#8220;some heaven/that has no fences,&#8221; after they find a rabbit &#8220;caught between the slats of the fence,” that he has had to kill. I feel he is asking for forgiveness, too, when he believes his child&#8217;s &#8220;prayer is right/ What more should heaven be? /A place made/ of wild carrot and dill…a warm October/day that never ends.&#8221;</p>
<p>These words cut me to the quick with their urgent, yet natural spirituality. I had to pause and say —yes— this is the way of it not only for the lives in the poems, for me the reader as well.</p>
<p>Both poems are republished below with permission from the author. <span id="more-4406"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Learning to Read&#8221; by Todd Davis</p>
<p>Before seatbelt laws and airbags began to pull</p>
<p>families apart, you let me ride up front, seated</p>
<p>between your legs. My joy when you told me</p>
<p>I was steering, too young to realize you held</p>
<p>the wheel below, was incommensurate with the act.</p>
<p>But what more does a five year old wish for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the back roads of Michigan, signs sprouted</p>
<p>like goldenrod and Queens Anne&#8217;s lace, and you</p>
<p>demanded I read them, pretending not to know</p>
<p>what to do if I didn&#8217;t. The weight of your words</p>
<p>was nothing like the impress of the declarations</p>
<p>written in bold black on yellow, or the infinite space</p>
<p>white made when placed on a metal so red</p>
<p>children at slumber parties would tell stories</p>
<p>of the dead whose blood colored it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, the weight I carried came from the letters</p>
<p>whose meaning I worked hard to explicate, trying</p>
<p>to understand how they offered either absolution</p>
<p>or extinction—our very future depending upon</p>
<p>how I sounded out S-T-O-P. Knowing now</p>
<p>you would have stopped whether I could read</p>
<p>the sign or not, I understand that learning to read,</p>
<p>like so much of life, is about faith and doubt—</p>
<p>the possibility of one, the heaviness of the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some Heaven&#8221; by Todd Davis</p>
<p>The rabbit&#8217;s head is caught</p>
<p>between the slats of the fence,</p>
<p>and in its struggle it has turned</p>
<p>so now the hind legs nearly touch</p>
<p>the nose—neck broken, lungs failing.</p>
<p>My boys ask me to do something</p>
<p>but see no mercy in my plan</p>
<p>to make sure the animal is dead.</p>
<p>At four and seven, they are so far</p>
<p>away from their own deaths</p>
<p>that they cannot imagine</p>
<p>the blessing a shovel might hold,</p>
<p>nor the lesson suffering offers</p>
<p>to those who have not suffered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At bedtime, my youngest prays</p>
<p>the rabbit is in some heaven</p>
<p>where there are no fences, where</p>
<p>in death there is more than enough</p>
<p>to eat. He begins to cry, and we rock</p>
<p>until sleep&#8217;s embrace takes him</p>
<p>from me. Sitting on his bed, I know</p>
<p>his prayer is right. What more</p>
<p>should heaven be? A place made</p>
<p>of wild carrot and dill, sunflower</p>
<p>and phlox, fields the stretch on</p>
<p>for miles, every coyote full, every</p>
<p>hawk passing over, a warm October</p>
<p>day that need never end.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chilly fall weather and the growing darkness have you huddling inside? Open up the latest edition of <i>Flyway</i> and let the electricity of our new content exhilarate you from head to toe.</p>
<p>Whet your artistic palate with our fresh visual art. Kristi Beisecker creates scintillating photograms by exposing organic objects to electricity and capturing the interaction on photosensitive paper. And take your time with Laurence Holden’s abstract paintings, which seem to glow from the inside.</p>
<p>On our poetic front, Donna Vorreyer takes you to the modern countryside in her poem “Foreclosure Pastoral.” Kirby Snell ponders a pelican carcass in “<i>Pelecanus occidentalis</i>.” And Kat Lewis prods the make-up of our intimate relationships in “We Are on Vacation” and “Our Lady of the Rockies Suddenly Reminds Me of You.”</p>
<p>On our prose front, fiction writer Elizabeth Rodriguez tells a tale you can’t stop reading in her short story “Three.” It’s about immigration, abuse, refuge, and hard choices. We have a special nonfiction feature by Cristina Eisenberg, judge of our 2014 Notes from the Field Nonfiction Contest (open for submissions until November 10). She writes about the science of climate change through the lens of old-growth forests in her essay “Environmental Writing and the Ecology of Hope.” Also in nonfiction, Sarah Robinson investigates the human perception of place during her travels through the American Southwest in “The Space of Desire.” And Mike LeSuer skewers pop culture’s infringement upon nature in “The Implicit Dangers of the Rogue Juice Box.”</p>
<p>We at <i>Flyway</i> deeply believe we’re publishing exciting, innovative, marvelous work, so please join us in celebrating it. Read on!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Place, image, rhythm, and balance are all integral to poetry. And when it comes to poetry, William Bonfiglio, one of <i>Flyway</i>’s two-prong poetry editorial team, brings a sharp eye and musicality to the table. A trained opera singer, accomplished dramatist and poet, William sat down with me for an interview last week to talk about his reading sensibility and his role as a poetry editor for <i>Flyway</i></p>
<p>“What I look for in poetry is a strong setting filled with lovely details. What we [Samantha Futhey, <i>Flyway</i>’s second poetry editor] look for is a complete piece, a story that is dependent on place, where place is a character — it should be treated as a fully-developed character. We pride ourselves on the poetry we publish, that it’s complete and polished for publication.”</p>
<p>Before entering Iowa State University, William earned his undergraduate degree at Bucknell University, where he studied with writers Paula Closson Buck and Shara McCallum.</p>
<p>“It was incredibly intimidating to be in that setting,” he said.</p>
<p>After Bucknell, William spent a gap year working the late shift at a supermarket. It’s this time that William says was his most productive writing period: he’d wake each morning and write before heading into his 2 to 9 p.m. shift. During this time William also traveled to Nova Scotia, read numerous poets and prose writers, and spent time in reflection, which solidified his conviction to pursue writing, eventually leading to his enrollment in Iowa State University’s Creative Writing and Environment program.</p>
<p>When asked about his views on environment in writing, William remarks, “When you volunteer for a journal of writing and environment, the stigma is that “environment” has to be some profound or progressive idea, when in fact, environment can be interpreted as simply as the idea of place, and the role that setting plays within inspiring stories and poetry and works of creative nonfiction. Personally, my writing has always been influenced by the place where I grew up, which spans everything from the East Coast to the home in which my parents raised me.”</p>
<p>Both Futhey and William are excited about upcoming content for <i>Flyway</i>. William describes many of the submissions to the magazine as “gifts” and says that it feels good to share these authors with the wider reading world.</p>
<p>So why serve as poetry editor? William remarks that so many writers have low self-esteem and little confidence &mdash; and that reading new material for <i>Flyway,</i> and the ability to see a wide scope of great writers, has made him more confident in his own writing.</p>
<p>“As a writer, I’m reading to better myself, to see other approaches by other writers,” he says.<i> </i>“I often ask myself what makes something memorable. I’m after that in my own writing and the writing we publish at <i>Flyway</i>.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five Bullet Review<br />
Mysterious Acts by My People<br />
by Valerie Wetlaufer</p>
<p>Sibling Rivalry Press<br />
Alexander, AR<br />
$13.46</p>
<p>Reviewed by Samantha Futhey</p>
<p>Valerie Wetlaufer’s poetry collection Mysterious Acts by My People questions the notion of mind over body, and unfolds mysterious acts tragic in their simplicity and beautiful in their grace. The power of the feminine dominates the collection as the speaker winds her way through emerging homosexuality, barriers to companionship, and how to exist in a violent, but passionate world.</p>
<p>o Many of the poems reveal the speaker’s emerging sexuality and portray violence inherent in sex: “Solitary Vice,” “Tender :: Throb,” and “The Pupil.” Wetlaufer is not afraid to be graphic with sex, displaying the consequences of simultaneous pain and pleasure in “Tender :: Throb:” “She does me from behind,/ her free hand tangled/ in my hair, so that my face/ points to the ceiling.”</p>
<p>o One fascinating theme in this book is the emphasis on homosexual love and the world of being a lesbian in this country. Poems such as “Solitary Vice” shows the speaker’s developing homosexuality and unrequited loves. “Tornado Alley” meshes the speaker’s voice with text from an anti-gay pamphlet, to create a multi-layered effect amplified by the shifting lines and use of empty space that strikes home the negative societal perceptions facing homosexuals: “A boy or a girl is only a boy or a girl/ until someone tells them otherwise./ Endorsing these lifestyles to the young/ of tender age confuses them and causes violence.// These were the longest years of our lives.”</p>
<p>o The central section of the book, Scent of Shatter, brings to life Mary Sweeny, an institutionalized Midwestern woman who was known as a “window-smasher.” Wetlaufer explores the murky territory of psychosis, weaving research with imagination and making this section of the collection the most memorable and evocative. In the poem “The Mind’s Boil,” the lines sprawled across the page indicate Sweeny’s underlying repression, rage, and her struggle in a world dominated by men: “the mind’s boil/strung high/follow orders/I escaped by smashing.”</p>
<p>o Lines like this: “In Florida, it rains like God hates you” (from “Love Poem in Three Parts”). Or the hurt of these lines, from “Twins:” “They will wear braces and casts to straighten their limbs/ &amp; the stares from other mothers in the street: unbearable.// Only one of them will live. I have to choose.” Wetlaufer’s poems brim with lines meant to sting, alarm, and provoke.</p>
<p>o Bird imagery, especially bones, reveals the speaker’s obsession with the body and preoccupation with distance. In poems such as “Anatomy,” “More Evidence for the Dinosaur/Bird Link,” “Sweet Albatross,” and “Avian Nightmare,” birds flit throughout the collection, the language twisted into beautifully haunted phrases. In “Sweet Albatross,” Wetlaufer combines body imagery with the haunting connotations of the albatross (though with possible irony calls the bird “sweet” in the title): “O diver, I will use your wingbones/ to tattoo ceremony onto my skin.”</p>
<p>Favorite poem: “Love Poem in Three Parts”<br />
Though many of the poems in this collection startle with the evocation of violence and imprisonment in the case of Mary Sweeny, “Love Poem in Three Parts” offers a space for tenderness in the midst of misunderstanding. Not only does this poem include the expertly crafted line mentioned previously, but in the third stanza/section the speaker brings home her female lover to meet the parents in a scene tense with awkwardness. Wetlaufer writes about the father observing the lover: “He’s trying not to regard your nipples. We/ were caught in the rain. Your thin cotton shirt/ is soggy and transparent.” The mother brings her own obvious discomfort to the table: “You’re so pretty. It’s what my mother can’t stop/ saying. She’s thinking about those glossy girls/ in magazines I kissed until the pages were limp/ &amp; newsprint showed through the faces.” The line breaks and use of caesura builds the tension, particularly in this stanza. But the poem ends delicately, in one of the most lovely images in the collection: “You dip your face/ into me like a kitten drinking milk, your whole face/ disappearing into the shallow bowl.” Fusing elements of sexuality, confusion, and body imagery, this poem represents the difficulties of the speaker, but gives a sense of hope that many of the other poems dodge.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SEPTEMBER 2014: NEW CONTENT!</p>
<p>Whether you’re kicking off a new academic year, wriggling under the weight of the dog days, or enthusiastically imbibing the heat of summer before it turns into fall, you want to make some room in your schedule for <i>Flyway’s</i> September, 2014, publication cycle.</p>
<p>To put your mind in an artistic mood, you may want to start by investigating our new visuals: evocative macro-photographs by Carolyn Guinzio.</p>
<p>Then head to our non-fiction sector — delight yourself with local food, fiddleheads, and fireflies. Allegra Hyde shares her experience preparing a locally-sourced meal on a Bahamian island in “Coming to the Table”; in “Eating Pieces of the Universe,” Pamela Baker remembers her youth in Maine, foraging for fiddleheads with her father, while she copes with her father’s new-found cancer; and Megan Ewald connects a familial disaster with her passion for the natural world and the magic of fireflies in her essay “Finding Luminescence.”</p>
<p>Our two new pieces of fiction this month visit the dark side, and you won’t be able to stop reading them. In Alisha Karabinus’s ”When Henry Sayles Ate a Bullet,” explore the depression and suicide of a police officer who’s downfall is deeply intertwined with the decline of his small Illinois town. And witness a wrenching freeway accident with the disgruntled narrator of Caleb Stone’s story “Tough World for Tigers.”</p>
<p>Last but never least, we’re featuring three new poems this month that are sure to bewitch you. “Surfeit” by Katherine L. Hester and “A Good Death” by Anne Haven McDonnell capture and reconstitute the pulsing season of summer in two extraordinarily unique, visceral ways. On a different track, fast-paced narrative poem “To the Man Who Ordered the Pad Kee Mow,” by Doc Suds, will have you looking at your ethnic food differently for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Enjoy this work, and thank you for reading, everyone!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, readers! Know how to beat the dog days this summer? Seat yourself in your cave-like living room or chilly cubicle, sip on a crisp drink, and surf the Internet — or, surf <i>our</i> Internet, Flyway.org. We have some new content this July that will keep your eyes glued to the screen.</p>
<p>Most pressingly, the winning and second-place stories of our annual Sweet Corn Short Fiction Contest are featured right now on the site! Winner Mike Alberti’s piece “The Gully” introduces us to boys growing up the hard way in rural Colorado. Runner-up Laura Price Steele’s piece “Going It Alone” brings us into the world of a young woman at an intersection with mortality. Believe it, you do not want to miss these excellent stories.</p>
<p>But there’s a lot more you don’t want to miss in <i>Flyway</i> this publication cycle. We have bees, boas, and alligator gar in our fabulous new nonfiction — Alison Townsend’s “A Jar of Wisconsin Honey,” Daniel Hudon’s “The Recovery Plan for the Round Island Burrowing Boa (<i>Bolyeria multocarinata</i>),” and Mark Spitzer’s “Enter the Next Generation.” And we have Georgia O’Keefe, big cats, and ghost towns in our outstanding new poetry, and it’s all double or nothing — two poems by Jessica Jacobs, two poems by Michael Pontacoloni, and two poems by Justin Runge.</p>
<p>Last but never, ever least, you ought to take the time to contemplate our stunning new visual art, by Elizabeth Castaldo.</p>

<p>As humidity softens, and a revived memory of winter solidifies those walls between interior and exterior, I find myself contemplating structure. We&#8217;ve ground up the ground, mixed it with water, and formed it into shapes that keep out the frostbite, or keep in a private self. Who we are under bare sky but swaddled in layers of wool, polyester fleece, or even just ideas, and who we are naked but under a ceiling, are strange inversions of the same thing. Thus I was drawn to these poems, which explore themes of structure, the material that builds it, and content in (and of) the void.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="&quot;On Metal&quot; by Jamaal May" href="https://gulfcoastmag.org/index.php?n=2&amp;si=50&amp;s=3142" target="_blank">On Metal</a>&#8221; by Jamaal May (from <i>Gulf Coast</i>)</p>
<p>&#8220;On Metal&#8221; contemplates how technology obscures mechanisms that can be intuitively understood &#8211; here, an engine. The sequestering of knowledge into increasingly esoteric arenas leaves us tempted to just let a specialist take over &#8211; but what about when they say no; when the machine stays silent?</p>
<p>&#8220;<a title="&quot;The Taking of Lead&quot; by Michael Lee" href="http://www.rattle.com/poetry/2013/07/the-taking-of-lead-by-michael-lee/" target="_blank">The Taking of Lead</a>&#8221; by Michael Lee (from <em>Rattle</em>)</p>
<p>In this four-part poem, the hand is a machine. The eye is an efficiency expert. Limitations come not inherent in structure, but in our failure to name beyond them. Like the machine-as-body in &#8220;On Metal,&#8221; in &#8220;The Taking of Lead&#8221; we see how &#8220;It seems to me this is all the body has ever wanted&#8221; &#8211; to forget its efficiency, and the naming which creates it. To live without, or beyond, language.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a title="&quot;The Sign with Nothing on it&quot; by Sarah Galvin" href="http://iopoetry.org/archives/1798" target="_blank">The Sign with Nothing on it</a>&#8221; and &#8220;Aubade&#8221; by Sarah Galvin (from <em>iO</em>)</p>
<p>These two poems speak on content, on void.  In &#8220;The Sign with Nothing on it,&#8221; literal absence presents as a prominent theme, while scent as a ghost &#8211; off the husk of a body whose purpose, foggy to a child, is obscured &#8211; fills in the rest with meaning.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Aubade,&#8221; more ghosts &#8211; of imagined memory, and of sound. I love the love of space captured in these lines: &#8220;I&#8217;ll shove my sleeping bag into a newspaper box, / and drag the box into a parking garage, / so I can live in both at once. / I refuse to interact with a structure any other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<a title="&quot;We are Both Sure to Die&quot; by Wendy Xu" href="http://thediagram.com/12_4/xu.html" target="_blank">We are Both Sure to Die</a>&#8221; (1st of two) by Wendy Xu (from <em>DIAGRAM</em>)</p>
<p>Wendy Xu&#8217;s poems easily deflect attempts at summary, but her fragmented-yet-cohesive style captures perfectly the chimeric synthesis of modern environment &#8211; both literal and psychological. In this poem, &#8220;Clutching a tiny molten piece / of someone else&#8217;s life&#8221; evolves through oxymoron and ultimatum into claiming vs. denying the body; denying vs. claiming death.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.pankmagazine.com/at-the-learning-annex/" target="_blank">At the Learning Annex</a>&#8221; by Jim Redmond (from <em>PANK</em>)</p>
<p>This last poem silvers the formal against the informal &#8211; textbook against the raw &#8211; into the real business of cutting down, with &#8220;a silver tongue / &#8230; anything / that will give up the solid.&#8221; Here, a reprisal (from the second poem) of war &#8211; this time the reasoning is a forgetting, too: a deconstruction forward, rather than back.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><strong>A Conversation with Sherwin Bitsui</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><i style="font-size: 13px;"></i>Friday, March 29<sup>th</sup>, 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">9th Annual Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness &amp; the Environmental Imagination: The Future of Water</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Sherwin Bitsui </b>is<i><b> </b></i>from White Cone, Arizona, on the Navajo Reservation. He currently lives in New Mexico. He is Dine of the Todich’ii’nii (Bitter Water Clan), born from the Tl’izlani (Many Goats Clan). He holds a BA from the University of Arizona and an AFA in Creative Writing from the Institute of American Indian Arts. Recent honors include: 2011 Native Arts &amp; Culture Foundation Arts Fellowship, 2011 Lannan Foundation Literary Fellowship, the 2010 PEN Open Book Award, an American Book Award, and a Whiting Award. He is the author of <i>Shapeshift</i> (University of Arizona Press, 2003) and <i>Flood Song</i> (Copper Canyon Press, 2009).</p>
<p>When Sherwin Bitsui came to Iowa State to speak at our Annual Wildness Symposium, <em>Flyway</em>&#8216;s Managing Editor Michelle Donahue had the opportunity to talk with him about his poetry.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>There are so many things I find fascinating about both <i>Shapeshift </i>and <i>Flood Song</i> but I think what was most intriguing was its form and length. In <i>Shapeshift </i>you have these tiny, short poems,while <i>Flood Song</i> is a book-length poem. What made you want to write a book-length poem? What sorts of decisions were involved there? And how was it different writing a book-length poem as opposed to individual poems?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Well, <i>Shapeshift</i> was my first book, so I entered with short pieces and I entered poetry in that way. There is a longer poem in <i>Shapeshift</i> called “The Northern Sun,” which is rather expansive, but it sticks to a three-page, prose-poem format. But then I also realized that I was writing in sections. I was writing shorter poems, but in sections. For some reason that seemed a little more true to my experience. I looked at my poetry and realized that somehow the white space or the negative space also informed the poem. And there needed to be silence between the pieces, so in <i>Shapeshift</i> there was that tendency to number a section, but it was still somehow contained within the poem. With <i>Flood Song</i> it seemed like the poem wanted to be expansive and it wanted to flood the horizon or the valley in which it was written. So the shape of <i>Flood Song</i> is really the shape of the flood. And it’s not a linear shape, it does move in many directions but the gravitational pull of the earth definitely is a direction in which the flood moves towards. In <i>Flood Song</i> there is movement but it is created by the world around it. The world created the reality that I’m in. I just had to follow it.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: So that flooding motion, is that why you chose to format it the way you did? The book has slightly wider pages and you space the passages of the poem very sparsely on the page sometimes. Is that feeding into that flooding movement? What made you decide that that was the right form for the poem?</p>
<p>Bitsui: There were moments where there was compression in the work and this adds to the musicality of the work. Sometimes a poem is so loaded with images and it is so compressed that it somehow blurs in the mind. I was interested in this idea of blurring and smearing because I’m also a visual artist. So I enacted that as a part of my process. Could I create this poem where I loaded the images on top of each other and they are going to collapse and on the following page they are going to be expansive again. Those came intuitively. I don’t think I did it conceptually. I think it just formed in that matter and I just followed it.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: Speaking of you being a visual artist, I noticed that you were the artist behind the cover art of <i>Flood Song</i>, which is this beautiful abstract, colorful painting that you’ve named “Drought.” So how do you think that art, “Drought” interacts with this poem, <i>Flood Song</i>?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Well, maybe they both create the same effect or feeling within the body in a way. Because I’ve been through drought, I’ve noticed my incredible longing for water. Not just for myself, but for the animals that we tended to and for the land. I was really aware of it as a young child. So the painting itself read the way that I read my poem <i>Flood Song</i>. If you noticed the smearing on the edges and its leading to something on the top right corner. Certainly I imagined that was an image of the flood. But it’s called “Drought.” Maybe “Drought” is flooding and maybe that’s the real poem. The image resonated with the intensity of <i>Flood Song.</i></p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: I wanted to talk a little about the Navajo language. I know you speak Navajo, but was it your first language? Or did you grow up speaking both Navajo and English?</p>
<p>Bitsui: It’s hard to say. I feel like Navajo is my first language. Diné Bizaad is my first language. But English was always spoken also. I think for up until I was five, Navajo was primarily spoken. Maybe I spoke a little bit of English. I don’t remember. But it wasn’t until I got to elementary school, middle school, and high school where my language really took a back seat to English; mainly when I went to school off the reservation in a public school in a border town. As a speaker of the Navajo language you didn’t speak it, because it wasn’t appreciated not just by other peers but also by the people in the education system.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: I read that you described the Navajo language as “complex and dense” and a language that brings out the sacredness in things, so how do you think growing up with this language influences the way you interact with English, primarily with your poetry?</p>
<p>Bitsui: I think speaking and being with another culture at a young age, I responded to a lot of our cultural perspectives regarding language. Navajo is very imagistic and descriptive and also very verb driven; everybody in my family spoke metaphorically about things and they spoke poetically about things. The notion of speaking and speaking well has an honorable place in the Navajo community. I saw this attention given to speakers at a very young age and I was made to speak publicly in family settings. So there was always this respect for language and craft and it fed into poetry naturally, it wasn’t ever outside of that.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: So with the title, <i>Flood Song</i> and many of the passages of it, the work reminded me of Whitman with all of his “Song of…” poems. Was that an influence you were aware of when you were writing? What poets do you think your works are influenced by? Were you actively in conversation with any poet(s)?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Not so much with <i>Flood Song</i>. In <i>Shapeshift</i> there is. There are some moments when Whitman is in conversation with me, or I’m in conversation with him. Not intentionally. I feel like I didn’t really have a floor. I couldn’t really hook it onto anything that was obvious to me. The only poet that I was in conversation with was probably my own traditional songs. Somehow I was trying to speak to the voices of before and the way they constructed their poems. It is a very voice-driven work and there is a visionary appeal to it, but there wasn’t really anyone that I could see. And I could see the long lines and the long breath reference that certain poets that have come before me use. I’m okay with that. I’m okay with those references, but the poem really grew out of this time and for whatever reason it did grow. And if there are influences, then I wasn’t trying to write “Song of Myself 2.0” or something. This poem was really born out of its time and for whatever reason, as poets we return to that form, whatever collisions occur, and then those poems emerge. I think Shermen Alexie, on the book jacket as a blurb, said he heard Whitman in these poems or he heard Ginsberg, so I won’t deny that aspect, but I don’t think I was reading them against each other when I was composing it, because the poems were written out of intuition and dreaming and trying to find a new way to speak to the present. But there still always is going to be an old way of speaking to any present. Anywhere.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: You mentioned earlier when you were writing <i>Flood Song</i> there was a sonic nature. Is that how you usually write poetry? How did you craft <i>Flood Song</i>—what steps did you go through to get it in its final state?</p>
<p>Bitsui: I wrote pieces of it and there was a balkanization of these pieces and they formed their own countenance and they broke up and they shifted with the time, whichever time I was in. Eventually I had a collection of work that didn’t belong within the short format poem structure. A lot of the reason why I built this long poem is simply because what had to be said, had to be said the way it’s going to be said. Also, even if I think about traditional Navajo songs or poems, poem-songs, they do operate in a very lengthy way. They are drawn out by the speaker who operates or recreates these poems from memory. So, the sonic quality is followed simply because it was comfortable for me to hear my poem spoken back to me. A lot of the process was giving the poems to anyone within an arms distance at some point and having them read my poem to myself. A section or maybe the whole poem. I composed it by ear. I also composed it in a way where, if the poem was in anybody’s voice, they would alter the poem with their own breath and I would listen for those nuances and I would listen for those line breaks that they were making. I would see if it worked or not. So the poem was really created by different people in a way. I wrote the words, but everybody altered the poem with their own voice at some point. Ultimately, I’m the one who created it, but I listened to how people responded to it. These were just people, not poets. Just anybody who would sit near me. I was this eccentric poet asking, “Hey, could you read this little piece for me?”</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: There’s such a sense of celebration, but also of tragic loss in <i>Flood Song</i>. For instance, you have, “where whale ribs / clasp and fasten you to a language of shifting ice” (11), an idea of moving land and losing land. You have lines that directly speak to loss, but also deal a lot with loss of sight or obstruction of sight with lines like: “I cover my eyes with electrical wires” (12), and “I bite my eyes shut between these songs” (4). How do you think loss plays out in <i>Flood Song</i>? Is it ultimately a balance between drought and flood? How did you think of loss when you were writing this? Or was that even conscious?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Probably unconscious. I don’t think I set out to write a poem about loss, it just emerged within the writing of the work. And all of those things were revealed later on. Also, I think someone once said, “All nature poetry is now elegy.” That was a recent quotation I had read, and wasn’t something I heard before writing this, but I thought it was interesting that we’re looking at nature and we’re imposing something on it that is somehow finite. It discontinues. But really it will continue and move forward. So <i>Flood Song,</i> I think is not so much about loss, but is a poem that exists in its time. And loss happens in time. But time moves past and births arrive. So there is that aspect to it; it accepts those things in a way that I personally can’t as a human being because I’m connected to things that I am connected to in a very familial way. I think I’m in a place now that even my language feels that it’s not being replanted in the voices of children. There is a kind of loss there too. But people are trying to teach the language in immersion schools, so there is hope. These things occur simultaneously. So all of that is a part of it. We’re moving so fast in all directions. I come from such a place that has been the root of my being for a millennia. How can you just move into this new world so easily? I question all of the things that are being lost. So, it’s a transitory piece and it’s a migrating piece. It’s very difficult to have to keep your foot in both worlds at the same time because you’ll be weighed down by the responsibilities that incur.</p>
<p><i>Flyway:</i> So when you wrote that wonderful line, “I map a shrinking map” is that a map of everything? Land, language, a way of life? Or did you have something more specific in your mind?</p>
<p>Bitsui: It’s probably a metaphorical map in a way. Or maybe it’s a psychic map. It’s definitely a map, maybe of language, which is shrinking. So many of our ideas are based on mapping and knowing and the taxonomy of knowing reality. Taxonomizing an experience. I really think one is shrinking and the need to map it also is the act of making it immortal and making it real for some other person to come to it and see the place that is imagined.</p>

<p>reviewed by Xavier Cavazos</p>
<p>Douglas Kearney’s cover design well fits Latasha N. Diggs new book of poems, <em>TwERK</em>: just as his design is composed of bright contrasting color, so too are Diggs’ poems, with multiple languages and contrasting syntax and line breaks and breath and rhythm.</p>
<p>Diggs is interested in many languages delivered as one universal tongue. She has published three chapbooks and has shared the stage with world heavyweights of song and verse and screen, and is now ready to claim her own title as poetic heavyweight. Diggs mixes Japanese with pop culture; Spanish with “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” Maori English and Samoan with “Che Fong’s Bungalow;” all with an abstract eye intertwined with a plausible narrative.</p>
<p>Truly an original voice!! And she doesn&#8217;t ignore nature and the natural world in favor of urban meditation. In the poem “My first Black Nature Poem,” Diggs celebrates the pain and ecology of the Bronx River:</p>
<p>&#8220;the Bronx River is said to be clean: we care about clean.<br />
a month before, two boys drowned in the Bronx River.<br />
a week after, a boy jumps into it unfazed.&#8221;</p>
<p>One river. One ocean. One voice. Unfazed, is what Latasha N Diggs communicates with her poems. Unfazed by the world’s hatred. Unfazed by love, by life, by animals, by relationships, by language, by fashion, by the world constructed in TwERK! Don’t be square!!</p>
<p>Diggs you all!<br />
Dig.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web Rove: Northern Exposures<br />
By Meg Brown</p>
<p>Popular imagination regards North Dakota and the surrounding northern plains region as sparsely-populated and culturally homogeneous “flyover country,” home to little else but wheat fields and prairie dogs. However, writers and artists who visit this country have long recognized the northern plains as a place of subtle beauty and tempered grace. Shaped by an increasing demand for energy and food, the northern plains region now plays a critical role in our nation’s economic and environmental future.</p>
<p>“<a title="The Emptied Prairie" href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/01/emptied-north-dakota/bowden-text.html" target="_blank">The Emptied Prairie</a>” by Charles Bowden and Eugene Richards (from <em>National Geographic</em>)</p>
<p>The northern plains region has been plagued for decades by “brain drain” – the outmigration of young educated people to large cities in other states, leaving a dwindling population and all-but-abandoned towns. In “The Emptied Prairie,” Charles Bowden takes us on a bleak tour of western North Dakota’s ghost towns. Don’t miss the gallery of chilling images from photographer Eugene Richards.</p>
<p>“<a title="The New Oil Landscape" href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/bakken-shale-oil/dobb-text" target="_blank">The New Oil Landscape</a>” by Edwin Dobb and Eugene Richards (from <em>National Geographic</em>)</p>
<p>When Eugene Richards returned to photograph western North Dakota in 2012, he encountered a far different story. With the advent of the technology needed to recover an estimated seven billion barrels of crude oil in the Bakken oil shale formation, North Dakota became the #2 oil-producing state, second only to Texas. Recession refugees from across the country flocked to the region by the thousands in search of oil industry jobs. Now the fastest growing state in the nation, North Dakota’s population is projected to grow 20% by 2020, and the influx has already caused housing shortages in cities as far east as Grand Forks and Fargo. Meanwhile, the use of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) brings the looming threat of pollution and permanent, catastrophic environmental damage.</p>
<p>“<a title="North Dakota's Oil Boom" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2013/03/north-dakotas-oil-boom/100473/" target="_blank">In Focus: North Dakota’s Oil Boom</a>” by Alan Taylor, Jim Urquhart, and Shannon Stapleton (from <em>The Atlantic</em>)</p>
<p>Ironically, the outmigration of young people due to “brain drain” meant that the few residents remaining in western North Dakota were people who were happy with the way things were. All but assured of the permanence of their lifestyle, they made their homes on the rural plains only to have their landscape rendered almost unrecognizable by the oil industry. It’s hard for outsiders to appreciate the enormity of the changes wrought upon the region now called “Kuwait on the prairie.” Barring a trip to visit it in person, this series of thirty photographs from <em>The Atlantic</em> might be the second-best way to witness a region in the grip of an unprecedented oil boom.</p>
<p>“<a title="The Same Cold" href="http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2012/02/19" target="_blank">The Same Cold</a>” by Stephen Dunn (from <em>The Writer’s Almanac</em>)</p>
<p>Residents of the northern plains have a saying: “Forty below keeps the riff-raff out.” Long winters and famously brutal cold define the climate of the northern plains, and certainly influence the social “climate” as well. In this poem, Stephen Dunn offers a convincing explanation for the well-documented phenomenon called “Minnesota Nice.”</p>
<p>“<a title="Indian Summer" href="http://www.americanlifeinpoetry.org/columns/233.html" target="_blank">Indian Summer</a>” by Diane Glancy (from <em>American Life in Poetry</em>)</p>
<p>The northern plains are a place of contradictions: an ever-present cycle of change coupled with a sense of retrogression and permanence. Diane Glancy, an indigenous voice and one of my favorite authors, captures these competing qualities in “Indian Summer.” She is not alone in her visualization of the prairie as “a horizon, an open sea” – at once a place of timelessness and new possibilities.</p>
