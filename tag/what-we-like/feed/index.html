								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey friends of Flyway, read on below for some of our editor&#8217;s selected reads from around the web. Happy November!</p>
<p><a href="http://brevitymag.com/current-issue/choom/" target="_blank"> “Choom”</a> / by: Jenny Boully (nonfiction in <em>Brevity</em>)<br />
Through a concise and lyrical list of details about a woman, BaNoi, a child deciphers her bewildering life.</p>
<p>“Mother says she would not like to die in this country; she says that when she dies, if she should die here, please take her home; she does not like what they do to dead bodies in this country; she says she will need monks to help carry her home.”</p>
<p><a href="http://annalemma.net/features/hostages.html" target="_blank">“Hostages”</a> / by Shannon Heffernan (fiction in <em>Annalemma</em>)<br />
Twin sisters negotiate secrets and their evolving relationship amidst a hostage situation happening in a nearby apartment building.</p>
<p>“Karen sits back in the tub. For a second she seems like a stranger and I try to figure out if she’s beautiful or ugly. But I love her and hate her too much to know what either of us really looks like.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sixthfinch.com/hogan1.html" target="_blank"> “Of Belief in the Nonexistence in Worlds that are Not our Own” </a>and <a href="http://sixthfinch.com/hogan2.html" target="_blank">“Scenes from a Massacre”</a> / by John Fenlon Hogan (poetry in <em>Sixth Finch</em>)<br />
I don’t really know what to say about these poems except that, after reading them, I wanted to find and immediately read Hogan’s other work!</p>
<p>“And I have seen enough movies to know / that I don’t know the world is almost / ending often, and I know of no other way / to woo her than with a sense of too much / fate.”</p>
<p><a href="http://thejournalmag.org/archives/2122" target="_blank">“Anatomy”</a> / by: Valerie Wetlaufer (poetry in <em>The Journal</em>)<br />
Birds and the body. Gorgeous language. Even the form attempts flight right out of this poem.</p>
<p>“My best lines to you are composed on vellum, the skin of a stillborn lamb. / I scrape the hide clean, / remove the hairs and rub it smooth with pumice.”</p>
<p>-*-</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last, meet <em>Flyway&#8217;s </em>creative director/ web czaress, <strong>Lindsay D&#8217;Andrea</strong>. You can find her updating the blog, tweeting, managing our Facebook page, and helping layout issue design. Consider her a behind-the-scenes editor.</p>
<div id="attachment_830" style="width: 376px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/newhair1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-830" class=" wp-image-830     " title="Lindsay D'Andrea" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/newhair1.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="302" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-830" class="wp-caption-text">Lindsay, with her most creative hair</p></div>
<p><strong><br />
What book can you not stop talking to people about?<br />
</strong>Ever since we circulated Anthony Doerr&#8217;s books around before last year&#8217;s <em>Wildness Symposium</em>, it&#8217;s been his collection of short stories, <em>The Shell Collector</em>. I just can&#8217;t get over how textured, heart-rending, complex, and epic Doerr stories are, and I recommend them to everyone. If you haven&#8217;t read it yet, that needs to be the first thing on your list. Starting now.</p>
<p><strong><br />
What book compels your writing?</strong><em></em><br />
I&#8217;ve read a lot of books on craft &#8212; too many, I think. Obviously <em>The Art of Fiction</em> is a staple. More than reading, though, I learn most from my professors and peers and the invaluable advice they give. Actually, from a different perspective, I feel most compelled to write by reading poetry<strong>, </strong>and my go-to (for now) has been  Stephen Dunn.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?<br />
I jump all over the place, sampling from a bunch of different online and print journals. I really like <em>Hayden&#8217;s Ferry</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, <em>Ecotone</em> (hurray for environmentally-minded journals!),<em> Necessary Fiction, the Rumpus, Orion, The Southern Review, AQR</em> &#8212; plus a lot more. I also love the visual art featured on <em>Escape into Life</em> and <em>Society 6</em>.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?<br />
Oh, gosh. I usually look for writers that have been on my &#8220;must-read-more&#8221; list like Karen Russell, Lauren Groff and Meghan Mayhew Bergman, but usually I read journals for the unknowns (like myself). I will just pick stories and poems at random and read them, with hope that someone out there is doing the same for me. I usually then try to follow those emerging writers on Twitter. Our technological internet-driven age means that reading shouldn&#8217;t be passive anymore&#8230;our capacity for communication is too great to ignore.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?<br />
Send us your best! A lot of times I feel like we get stories that have not been polished or edited properly or extensively. We have pretty high standards, here, and we always want the best you can give. For visual art, I look for interesting composition (in photographs) or complex relationships between visual elements. Obviously, we &#8220;like&#8221; plants and rocks and fields and pastorals, but that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re really about&#8230;surprise us with your new ideas about the environment&#8230;it&#8217;s changing at a rate that can no longer sustain a boxed-in definition.<strong></strong></p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Meet <strong>Lindsay Tigue,</strong> our Non-fiction editor with a love for all genres. She&#8217;s one to borrow a book from, if you&#8217;re in need.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meet <strong>Lindsay Tigue,</strong> our Non-fiction editor with a love for all genres. She&#8217;s one to borrow a book from, if you&#8217;re in need.</p>
<div id="attachment_826" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ltigue3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-826" class="size-full wp-image-826" title="Lindsay Tigue, non-fiction editor" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ltigue3.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="338" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-826" class="wp-caption-text">Lindsay Tigue, non-fiction editor</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><br />
I already reviewed this on this blog over the summer, but <em>The Field Guide to Getting Lost </em>by Rebecca Solnit. I am <em>still</em> talking about it. It&#8217;s the kind of book where as soon as I put it down I needed to pick up another by the same author. More Solnit. I love her blend of historical and personal; the balance she achieves seems to me more fluid than a lot of nonfiction I come across.</p>
<p>As far as poetry, I cannot stop talking about <em>Words for Empty and Words for Full</em> by Bob Hicok. Not to sound hyperbolic, but I feel differently about words after reading these poems, particularly the ones about the Virginia Tech shootings. He seems to get away with so much with so little. I love that.</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><em><br />
Boys of My Youth</em> by Jo Ann Beard, <em>The Collected Stories</em> by Amy Hempel, A<em>t the Drive-In Volcano</em> by Aimee <em>Nezhukumatathil</em>, <em>Among the Missing</em> by Dan Chaon. Depending on what genre I am trying to write, these are the books I need to read and reread. Without fail, they make me want to try again. They all achieve something I really want to do.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I love <em>Third Coast</em>, <em>Ecotone</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, <em>Ninth Letter</em>, <em>Colorado Review</em>, <em>Black Warrior Review</em>, <em>Indiana Review</em>, <em>Sycamore Review</em>, <em>One Story</em>, and oh so many others.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t necessarily read literary magazines because I recognize a name. The fun is in the discovery—the heartrending essay, story, or poem by someone whom I&#8217;ve perhaps never run across before. That being said, I get excited when I see a literary magazine has a story by L. Annette Binder. I was first introduced to her work through literary magazines and I can&#8217;t wait to read her first collection, <em>Rise</em>, which was just published by Sarabande.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
At <em>Flyway</em>, our aesthetic centers around place and the environment and the essays that stand out to me are ones interpreting a confrontation or interaction with place in a surprising way. I also like essays that feel well-structured, but not contrived. I like essays where characters (including the narrator) emerge, essays where the characters become as important as the idea. There should also be some force driving the momentum of the piece, whether it&#8217;s suspense or some overarching desire or motivation that gets me to read on. I also hate to see disparaged “quiet essays,” or “quiet poems,” or “quiet stories,” as if words must to be loud to matter. I love calm human drama. I love tension. The subtle essay that doesn&#8217;t shout can often accumulate shocking power. And, really, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for; I want to be moved and surprised. Break my heart, contributors!</p>

<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Poetry</span>: Maurice Manning – <em>A Common Man </em>and <em>A</em> <em>Companion for Owls</em><em><br />
</em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Short Story<em>:</em></span> Anthony Doerr – <em>The Shell Collector</em><em><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><br />
Often the last book I read compels my writing, and when I feel stalled and uninspired I might return to something by some of my favorites: Wendell Berry, William Stafford, Seamus Heaney, Mary Oliver, Galway Kinnell, Pablo Neruda, Salvatore Quasimodo, Sharon Olds, Louise Gluck, and Yusef Komunyakaa. This list probably keeps going.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than Flyway) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I’ll typically read whatever falls into my hand or strikes my momentary interest. But a few magazines I return to, subscribe to, or prefer: Cave <em>Wall</em>, <em>Appalachian Heritage</em>, <em>Whitefish Review</em>, <em>One Story</em>, <em>Ecotone</em>, <em>The Sun</em>, <em>The Paris Review</em>, and <em>Poetry</em>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
They may all be super famous already, but these names would definitely pique my interest in a journal: Track K Smith, Bob Hicok, Sandra Beasley, Aimee Nezhukumatathil, D.A. Powell, Maurice Manning, Frank X Walker, Linda Pastan, Natasha Trethewey, or Geoffrey Brock.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of Flyway?</strong><br />
Read books. Read magazines. Read <em>Flyway</em>! Write and submit and plant trees.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our new <em>Flyway</em> fiction editor, Lydia Melby, is straight outta Texas (but don&#8217;t tell her I told you). Read below for more important information.</p>
<div id="attachment_821" style="width: 319px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/220038_808697576957_1520514839_o.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-821" class=" wp-image-821     " title="Lydia with Wolf Pup" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/220038_808697576957_1520514839_o.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="232" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-821" class="wp-caption-text">Lydia with Wolf Pup</p></div>
<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><em><br />
The God of Small Things</em>. <em>Ship Breaker</em>. Mary Karr’s memoirs. Do I need to pick one? Sometimes I want to read a fast-paced YA novel about the futuristic Gulf communities complete with clipper ship chase scenes, and sometimes I want to read a lovely, lyrical novel dissecting how small choices and small betrayals can all pile together for a catastrophic end. Sometimes I want to read a fellow Texan’s sassy-assed recounting of her life and thoughts about religion, family, and writing. I’m reading <em>The Night Circus</em> right now, too, and it’s fantastic—it’s difficult to stay on track with my class readings when I have such a lively, brilliant story within reach. I’ve been putting it away in my room when I work.</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><em><br />
The English Patient</em>, ultimately (or really, anything by Ondaatje). I’ve never read a more perfectly realized, more devastating book (though <em>The God of Small Things</em> and <em>The Cat’s Table </em>come close). I read<em> Stay Awake </em>this summer and was floored. I’m reading it for the third time now—Chaon’s eerie lyricism is so subtle and so atmospheric that you get that ringing in your ears.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I read <em>The Fairy Tale Review, The Southern Review, American Short Fiction </em>(please don’t shut down!)<em>, Ecotone, Idaho Review, Gulf Coast, Bellevue, Bat City, </em>and<em> Fiddleblack, </em>cover to cover, and really love<em> The Collagist, DrunkenBoat,  Fwriction, Pank, Lit, Granta, The Paris Review, The Atlantic, A Capella Zoo, Pleiades, Ninth Letter, Sonora Review</em> and too many to really name.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
Upper Middle Class White Male Authors. Especially if they’re long-established voices, have published several times, and are writing about hetero-normative relationships taking place in New York City/LA/The Midwest. I really like it when their narrator is speaking in first person present, is frustrated with how he’s not understood by family/society, and/or has an epiphany about how their wife/ girlfriend/ new baby makes them feel trapped.</p>
<p>Obviously (I hope), that’s sarcasm. I look for writers that can shock me, writers I don’t necessarily recognize, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
I feel like a lot of current short stories tend to ignore the necessity of a compelling plot to lean on other elements—like an idiosyncratic voice, or really detailed descriptions. I don’t mean that I’d rather mostly plot, but I’m looking for balanced stories—and yeah, that’s hard to do.</p>
<p>Personally, I really enjoy tension and a sense of mystery. Or, to quote Raymond Carver, I want to read stories with at least &#8220;a little menace…There has to be tension, a sense that something is imminent, that certain things are in relentless motion, or else, most often, there simply won&#8217;t be a story.&#8221;</p>
<p>For <em>Flyway</em> in particular, there should be tension between the environment or setting of the story and the characters in it. A well-known place should appear new, even alien and strange through the eyes and actions of the characters. I want to see an active environment, too—a setting that influences actions, triggers it’s one events.</p>
<p>One of my professors has a Dianne Arbus photo on his wall—the one of the frustrated little boy holding a grenade in central park—and he pointed out part of what makes the photo so memorable (besides the little critter’s facial contortions) is that she had a special lens that made the background and environment tilted, a little bent-looking, while the foreground was in realistically sharp focus. He said that’s the kind of story he likes to read and write—one where the center is sharp and realistic, and the outer edges are starting to bend or collapse.</p>

<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><em><br />
Fire Season: Notes from a Wilderness Lookout </em>by Philip Connors</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?<em><br />
</em></strong><em>The Writing Life</em><em> </em>by Annie Dillard</p>
<p><strong>What (other than Flyway) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I read a whole helluva lot of them…but I subscribe to <em>River Styx, the Florida Review </em>(of course)<em>, Poetry, The Sun, Cave Wall</em>, and I’m probably forgetting others. Also, online I read a lot of community writing like <em>theRumpus, Hobart, the Millions, PANK, HTML Giant, </em>et al.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
I love to find any piece by Ira Sukrungruang. I like Ben [Percy’s] modern folktales. Billy Collins seems to be in any and all lit mags. Alex Lemon’s poems are solid. Brian Doyle’s prose-poem/auto-fiction/close-to-the-heart-nonfiction. Steve Almond’s love/sex/breakup-stories. Jeffrey Brown’s memoir-and/or-satirical comics. &#8230;Megan Mayhew Berman and her animal stories. Caitlin Horrocks; though, she’s mostly in “the slicks” now. Anything by these two amazing Florida gals: Karen Russell and Laura Van den Berg. Lindsay Hunter’s wild and weird stories!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
Address your cover letters to the appropriate editor. Seriously.</p>
