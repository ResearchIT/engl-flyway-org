								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Nick Bogdanich<br />
</em><br />
As a fan of the post apocalyptic genre, I appreciated Peter Heller’s knowledge of the canon.  His novel <em>The Dog Stars </em>features allusions to everything from <em>Mad Max</em> to Cormac McCarthy’s <em>The Road</em>, to the television show <em>Life After People</em>.  Where many post apocalyptic narratives seem to dispense with all but the most abstract references to some barely relevant past, Heller’s landscape is more firmly rooted in the detritus of civilization.  In this way, <em>The Dog Stars</em> justifies itself among other examples of the genre by begging the question: what draws us to it?  Why do we relish imagining ourselves in scenarios where society has fractured and our only function is survival?</p>
<p>The novel’s protagonist Hig is having trouble adapting to the apocalypse, although, despite the loss, loneliness, and killing, things are actually looking up for him.  His compound is well fortified and well stocked.  He spends his days fishing in the woods with his dog and going on Coca-Cola runs in his small plane to an overturned delivery truck.  For Hig’s gun enthusiast survival partner Bangley, the apocalypse has uncovered his true calling: guarding the perimeter of the compound.  He scoffs at Hig for taking too much recreational pleasure in fishing trips, which Bangley considers risky and lacking sufficient return in resources.</p>
<p>The relationship between these two characters is one of this novel’s most compelling devices.  Hig struggles to maintain the status quo with his psychopathic partner, who seems to prefer the safety of solitude to accommodating Hig’s impetuous questing for both, minor luxuries, and a greater significance to life than mere survival.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Bangley] didn’t do anything that wasn’t aimed at surviving…Sometimes I think the only reason he kept me around was so he had someone to witness his prowess in the winning of each day…to let me know that it was him.  That he vouchsafed our survival…”</p></blockquote>
<p>Heller entices the reader with this Eden that Bangley provides through a sniper’s scope, truncating pastoral, taxonomy laden descriptions of the Colorado plains with jarring instances of trespassers gunned down indiscriminately and turned to jerky for the dog.  In these scenes, the pared down, halting syntax obfuscates only occasionally and permits a close, unrefined perspective on the mounting tensions that lead Hig to consider leaving this safe haven which most post apocalyptic characters set out in search of.</p>
<p>Since the relationship between Hig and Bangley is more complex and unique than the love interest that fills its place in the second half of the novel, I wish Hig could have taken Bangley with him.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">If I thought I could defend this place by myself I would shoot Bangley where he stands and get it over with.  Would I?  Maybe.  And then I would miss this sparring every day…we really have become like a married couple.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>We can’t help but be disappointed when Heller trades this weird tension for the trivial awkwardness that precedes Hig’s romance, which seems like a foregone conclusion from his first encounter with the love object Cima.  Heller also attempts to fill Bangley’s void with the character of Pops, who by Hig’s own description is a lot like Bangley, and feels rehashed to the reader.</p>
<p>Where Heller really shines is in his elegiac descriptions of the rivers along which Hig fishes.  It’s a testament to Heller’s command of language and detail that he can make us grieve and root for the environment itself amidst all the human strife that takes place within it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I heard a canyon wren, the six seven eight paced notes whistling down a scale never used by man. I…saw the dipping flight of the kingfisher I’d seen almost every morning.  Moving fast up the stream.  The bigger rivers like the Gunnison weren’t drying up.  Not yet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hig takes refuge in these strongholds.  The ugliness that society embodies in its present form drives him to them, and makes him appreciate their potential for regeneration all the more. *</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Review by Lydia Melby</span></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">“When the hail came, when the river bucked and broke its banks, when the children lay awake in the late hours fevered and coughing—they knew this place belonged to the devil, had always belonged to him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter" title="Little Wolves cover" alt="" src="http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1333581093l/13536606.jpg" width="223" height="303" /></p>
<p>Thomas Maltman’s second novel, <em>Little Wolves</em>, a 2013 Indie Next pick, has been called a literary thriller, a poetic mystery, called gothic and mythic and haunting. It is a book that defies attempts to assign it a genre, category, or explanation. It is a book that bewilders and excites, moves and mystifies.</p>
<p><em>Little Wolves</em> takes it’s title from an old Cheyenne (and other American Indian nations) term for coyotes. While this isn’t a common name for <em>Canis Latrans</em> in most rural Minnesota communities, the setting of this novel, a small town “about 200 miles west of the Twin Cities” called Lone Mountain, occupies a realm of the surreal and fantastic, where American Indian, Anglo-Saxon, and biblical mythologies wage war, and where coyotes play their little part in other “wolves’” lives. While it’s a “pretty enough town at first glance,” with “women sweeping their porches, the men cutting precise patterns on riding lawnmowers,” a town with church luncheons and lock-ins and an annual Longfellow pageant, Lone Mountain is also a place where it’s inhabitants talk frankly of the devil’s threat, where lone billboards command <em>Thou Shalt Not Kill</em> “in stark black and white” and where residents are still counted strangers twenty=five years after their move.</p>
<p><em>Little Wolves</em> opens in the hours after a troubled teenage boy methodically sawed the barrel off his new shotgun, “limped into town” and shot the town sheriff in the face before committing suicide in a cornfield. The story follows the effects this tragedy has on the boy’s father, Grizz, and Clara, an expecting mother who recently moved to Lone Mountain with her pastor husband and taught Seth’s high school English class.</p>
<p>As Grizz tries to understand how he seemingly knew so little about his son, the boy who saved and raised orphaned coyote pups, Clara tries to come to terms with her own family troubles—a barely-remembered mother, who died under mysterious circumstances, an overbearing father who mythologized her mother’s death with adjusted folklore and legends, and a distant husband preoccupied with his work and ambivalent about their coming child. And as both grope for understanding, they find instead more questions and dark hints, signs for those who would see, that Lone Mountain shelters secrets more vicious than their legends.</p>
<p>In its best moments, <em>Little Wolves</em> is remarkable, a starkly hewn northern gothic in the vein of McCarthy or O’Connor’s southern standards of the genre. Maltman’s prose, especially when describing the desolate prairie in drought or in winter or when suggesting the presence of the Other, a hovering sensation of a figure standing behind you in the dark, that ungrounding when you realize no one is who you thought.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter" title="Maltman, author" alt="" src="http://thomasmaltman.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tom-blue-shirt-filter2.jpg" width="378" height="284" /></p>
<p>In Lone Mountain, Maltman brings together several very real threats—a violent outburst, menacing authorities, stone-faced secrets, drought, modernization, even the coming winter. The story takes off with the first two jarring, gripping chapters, and as the tension piles on, the reader’s flush of adrenaline seems a natural and necessary reaction.</p>
<p>Atop this gritty realism are many layers of the supernatural—Clara’s obsession with Anglo-Saxon mythology, and her belief that both the legend of Beowulf and of her missing mother hold the key to some great mystery, collides with her husband’s (and the community’s) fear of Satan and God’s wrath and Grizz’s lifelong fixation on the Hiawatha lore. Admittedly, these elements are heavy doses taken all together, but Maltman uses these devices to sketch what his expert tone has already implied—a pervading darkness hovering over the town, seeping in at the edges of everyone’s vision but impossible to face head on.</p>
<p>With <em>Little Wolves</em>, Maltman weaves a beautiful, bewildering cloth. His plot, which begins anchored in the gritty realism he does so well, becomes slightly unmoored by its own fantasy as the many loosely knotted narrative threads twist into something vague and inscrutable. However, the characters, though often baffling in interaction and motivation, are sympathetic and genuine, while the suspense and eerie atmosphere certainly earns <em>Little Wolves</em> its loose ends and indulgences.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the considerable strength of <em>Little Wolves</em> lays in how deftly the author evokes his lovely, unsettling landscape—dropping readers into a scene, a fear, a town, a way of life. Even as the plot grows chaotic, Maltman’s prose does not falter—many passages caught my breath and brought me back to reread and savor, like the passage below, as Grizz broods over a rifle, “a cold deadweight… the farm boys in this stretch of country grew up with.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left">“They became teenagers who shot at street signs from moving cars or shot loads of buckshot straight up in the sky and then scurried for cover before the deadly lead rained down. They grew up and the guns grew with them. A .410 could take down a coon or even a small deer at close range; a 20 gauge could pluck a fleeing pheasant or goose from the blue. Shot or slug, steel or lead, they could cite velocities and tell stories of the improbably kill or the one that got away. They ate what they killed, mostly, but sometimes they killed out of boredom… kills they later regretted but could not undo.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This moment, eerily relevant today, is just one of many that echo in the reader’s skull. And that, perhaps, is the mark of a fine novel—not the number of loose threads or missing answers, but rather something that strikes deep enough that we care enough to circle these stranded questions hours, days, even weeks after we have closed the book.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Michelle Donahue</em></p>
<p>January marks the time when weather starts getting cold. <em>Really </em>cold. In most parts of the country there is always snow in January and even if there isn’t, chill has settled in and big, bulky coats become an every day staple. Certainly, no one shows much skin in January. And so, the inner Californian and heat-lover in me, thinks it’s important in these cold times to remember warm, bare-skin weather.</p>
<p>So in this week’s web-rove, I bring you three short pieces, one from each genre, that feature skin, specifically women’s skin.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pankmagazine.com/my-birthday-suit/">“My Birthday Suit”</a> poetry by Mia Sara (on <em>PANK)<br />
</em>This inventive poem on growing old inverts the ideas of clothing and nakedness. I admire the brutality and sadness and I love how the narrator describes that she is turning inside out.</p>
<p><a href="http://thefiddleback.com/issue-items/this-land-is-my-land">“This Land is My Land”</a> fiction by Samuel Ligon (on <em>The Fiddleback)<br />
</em>This short piece packs a powerful punch. Though skin certainly isn’t a main focus of this, a girl “with the skin condition” becomes one of many people who cannot be happy in the narrator’s imagined “intellectual property”. This work is about the illusion of happiness and the illusions inherent in all of our lives.</p>
<p><a href="http://brevitymag.com/current-issue/in-our-skin/">“In Our Skin”</a> nonfiction by Diana Cage (on <em>Brevity</em>)<br />
The prose here sings. This beautiful essay touches on skin and heat and love. The beauty of two women, hot and laid out on a quilt juxtaposes wonderfully to more serious ramifications of heat—burnings, deaths by dehydration and more.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today we&#8217;re ringing in the New Year with a web rove by our nonfiction editor, Lindsay Tigue. </em></p>
<p>-*-</p>
<p>This holiday break, my online reading has mostly consisted of poetry. I usually fall down a poem rabbit hole; I search out all of the pieces published online by a certain writer and then realize I should just order their collection.</p>
<p>One poet I recently stumbled across in this manner is <a href="http://www.nick-lantz.com/Nick_Lantz/About.html"><strong>Nick Lantz</strong></a>. His poems rely on historical research, but they associate to surprising emotional cores. His poems do something I try to do, weaving in facts and the heart of some story, some core feeling at the very bottom of an informative poem.</p>
<p>Nick Lantz has two published collections of poetry <em>We Don’t Know We Don’t Know</em> which won the Bakeless Prize, and <em>The Lightning That Strikes The Neighbors House</em>. In <em>We Don’t Know We Don’t Know</em>, Lantz explores the way politics degrades language.</p>
<p>I couldn’t decide which of poems to share, so here are four that can be read online:<br />
<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/240422" target="_blank">“What We Know of Death by Drowning”<br />
</a><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/shortstack/2010/03/poets_choice_will_there_be_mor.html" target="_blank">“Will There Be More Than One ‘Questioner’?”<br />
</a><a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/21447" target="_blank">“Ancient Theories”<br />
</a><a href="http://howapoemhappens.blogspot.com/2010/09/nick-lantz.html" target="_blank">“The Year We Blew Up the Whale—Florence, Oregan.”</a></p>
<p>I’ve also been reading some of those inexhaustible year-end best-of book lists lately, particularly which poetry collections people think top 2012. One collection that appeared on some lists was Rebecca Lindenberg’s debut collection, <em>Love: An Index</em>, a book she wrote about her relationship with poet Craig Arnold, who disappeared while hiking a volcano in Japan in 2009. <a href="http://believermag.tumblr.com/post/20008046344/rlindenberg" target="_blank">In an interview with <em>The Believer,</em>  Lindenberg talks about the seemingly daunting task of writing a love story</a>. She says, “I wanted to write love poems in a poetic and academic culture that insists love poetry is ‘soft,’ sentimental stuff. The kind of stuff girls like. Of course, anybody who’s read anything knows the tradition of the love lyric is much more than that—it’s economic, political, rebellious, religious, clever, kinky, psychologically slippery, deeply humane.” She talks about how adopting the form of an index helped her “render both the passionate and intellectual aspects of a love story.”</p>
<p>After reading about Lindenberg’s book, I started reading poems by both her and Craig Arnold and thinking about the challenges of writing about love. In the article <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/182917" target="_blank">“How to Write Love Poems”</a> on the Poetry Foundation website, Arnold discussed, in 2009, the pitfalls and rewards of writing one of the most universal human emotions. He said, “Let’s face it, nobody in love is original. We all feel and do pretty much the same things, make fools of ourselves in the same ways, and hopefully come through it alive and well and happily in bed with someone else. But that’s also precisely the appeal of love poetry, the intensely humbling nature of the experience it tries to describe.”</p>
<p>Here are some beautiful poems about love from both Lindenberg and Arnold:<br />
<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/182920" target="_blank">“Bird-Understander”</a> by Craig Arnold<br />
<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/243898" target="_blank">“Marblehead”</a> by Rebecca Lindenberg</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We here at Flyway wish everyone a Happy New Year! Take a break from the festivities to check out our latest Web Rove for this season.</p>
<p><a href="http://monkeybicycle.net/dirty-birds/">“Dirty Birds”</a> by Blaze Kinzey (from <em>Monkeybicycle)<br />
</em>This piece of flash fiction jumps right into its story, just as the genre requires, and we learn that the sad reality that this story can be told over and again. Though we don’t really get a clear sense of what’s at stake for these two brothers, we feel like we do, and it doesn’t feel too good.</p>
<p><a href="http://english.wisc.edu/devilslake/issues/spring2012/Lawless.html"> “Factoryville Eclogue”</a> by Gregory Lawless (from <em>Devil’s Lake</em>)<br />
I love the terse language of this poem, and really admire the last image of the spilled lumber truck, freezing over and circled by ravens.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.versedaily.org/2012/onomens.shtml"> “On Omens”</a> by Mark Wunderlich (from <em>Verse Daily</em>)<br />
This has that really simple but descriptive language that really leaps to different meaning because of the more abstract in the poem. Somehow the simple image of two coyotes crossing the yard hits so well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.decompmagazine.com/huntergatherer.htm">“hunter gatherer”</a> by kelly schirmann (from <em>decomP</em>)<br />
This poem succeeds where I see a lot of other poems failing; it blends the clear narrative story with striking imagery and abstract ideas.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/172201"> “Advent”</a> by Mary Jo Salter (from <em>Poetry</em>)<br />
And a Christmas poem!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just last Sunday, we hosted our annual Flyway Benefit Auction to great success. Thank you to everyone who donated something by participating in one of the events we featured Sunday night. For those friends of Flyway who couldn&#8217;t be there in person, thank you for always being there in spirit. We are about to undergo some big changes, so your support mean all the more to us at this time!</p>
<p>To celebrate the post-benefit/ post-election, here are a few creative selections from around the web in this week&#8217;s web rove:</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/mean/arthur-krystal-and-everyones-favorite-genre-fiction-fallacy/">Arthur Krystal and Everyone&#8217;s Favorite Genre Fiction Fallacy</a>&#8220;<em> </em>by Mike Meginnis (from <em>HTML Giant</em>)<br />
Mike bends and blurs genre; such as his recent &#8220;Navigators&#8221; originally published in <em>Hobart</em> and then included in the <em>Best American Short Stories 2013</em>. He also defends and defines genre as way to compel plot, while also still being a good story. Have a read and then weigh in on the conversation in the comments section.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/343316/the-artist-and-the-critic-8-famous-authoreditor-relationships">The Artist and the Critic</a>&#8221; by Emily Temple (from <em>Flavorwire)</em><br />
Last fall I read the tome <em>Max Perkins: Editor of Genius</em> by biographer A. Scott Berg, which includes the Scribner editor&#8217;s trying relationships with a trifecta of the famous authors F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe. This list of eight editing relationships starts with Perkins and Wolfe, but includes seven other pairings. Throughout them all consider how an editor is a super-reader for a writer.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.worldhum.com/features/travel-stories/why-we-travel-20081213/">Why We Travel</a>&#8221; by Pico Iyer (from <em>WorldHum</em>)<br />
This is a manifesto from a transnational who has witnessed the world by participating in it via travel. Iyer shows both directions of leaving and returning: what we take there and what we bring back. Go on an imaginative trip just by reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/oct/24/simon-garfield-top-10-maps">Top 10 Books with Maps</a>&#8221; by Simon Garfield (from <em>the Guardian</em>)<br />
As cliche as it sounds for this to be a starting point on a journey of maps, this list offers just that. These books include maps on the author&#8217;s radar. Of course, there&#8217;s more than just these ten, so why not add to the list your own favorite maps in books?</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/443/please_dont_vote_for_me">Please Don&#8217;t Vote for Me</a>&#8221; by Sparrow (from <em>the Sun</em>)<br />
As the editors note: &#8220;The poet and political provocateur Sparrow has run for U.S. president in every election since 1992. Sometimes he runs as a Republican and other times as a member of a party of his own invention — the Pajama Party, the Ear of Corn Party, the Sudoku for All Party. To his knowledge he has never received any votes, but this seems only to encourage him.&#8221; Find out why Sparrow even runs, what his &#8220;issues&#8221; are, and how he never gets any votes in this tongue-in-cheek piece.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Election Day! In between poll lines and election parties, check out a few selections for what to read around the web, handpicked by our poetry editor, Andrew Payton.</p>
<p>Also, some news:<br />
Our <strong>Notes from the Field nonfiction contes</strong>t deadline has officially been extended to Monday, November 12! For submission guidelines, click <a href="flyway.org/contests" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>-*-</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v5n2/poetry/levis_l/grass.htm" target="_blank">Some Grass along a Ditch Bank</a>” by Larry Levis (from Blackbird)<br />
A poem about grass by a great poet.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://anti-poetry.com/johnsonam2/" target="_blank">It’s the Kingfish, Honey—Pining</a>” by Amaud Jamaul Johnson (from Anti-)<br />
I’m not exactly sure what’s going on or how Johnson makes this short poem happen, but it’s got great voice and a wonderful ending.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.fifthwednesdayjournal.com/selections/poetry.shtml" target="_blank">Pit Ponies</a>” by Theodosia Henney (from Fifth Wednesday)<br />
I like poems where I learn things that I didn’t expect to learn about. Ponies in mines. Hmm.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v5n2/poetry/black_r/tolberton.htm" target="_blank">Tolberton County, 1923</a>” by Rebecca Black (from Blackbird)<br />
This is just a mighty fine poem.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.tingemagazine.org/i-looked-for-you-i-called-your-name/" target="_blank">I Looked for You, I Called Your Name</a>” by Laura van den Berg (from Ploughshares, republished in<br />
TINGE)<br />
I’d been wanting to read a story by this author for some time, and this is the one I stumbled on. I know it’s already got a bit of attention, but I enjoyed it and so should you.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey friends of Flyway, read on below for some of our editor&#8217;s selected reads from around the web. Happy November!</p>
<p><a href="http://brevitymag.com/current-issue/choom/" target="_blank"> “Choom”</a> / by: Jenny Boully (nonfiction in <em>Brevity</em>)<br />
Through a concise and lyrical list of details about a woman, BaNoi, a child deciphers her bewildering life.</p>
<p>“Mother says she would not like to die in this country; she says that when she dies, if she should die here, please take her home; she does not like what they do to dead bodies in this country; she says she will need monks to help carry her home.”</p>
<p><a href="http://annalemma.net/features/hostages.html" target="_blank">“Hostages”</a> / by Shannon Heffernan (fiction in <em>Annalemma</em>)<br />
Twin sisters negotiate secrets and their evolving relationship amidst a hostage situation happening in a nearby apartment building.</p>
<p>“Karen sits back in the tub. For a second she seems like a stranger and I try to figure out if she’s beautiful or ugly. But I love her and hate her too much to know what either of us really looks like.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sixthfinch.com/hogan1.html" target="_blank"> “Of Belief in the Nonexistence in Worlds that are Not our Own” </a>and <a href="http://sixthfinch.com/hogan2.html" target="_blank">“Scenes from a Massacre”</a> / by John Fenlon Hogan (poetry in <em>Sixth Finch</em>)<br />
I don’t really know what to say about these poems except that, after reading them, I wanted to find and immediately read Hogan’s other work!</p>
<p>“And I have seen enough movies to know / that I don’t know the world is almost / ending often, and I know of no other way / to woo her than with a sense of too much / fate.”</p>
<p><a href="http://thejournalmag.org/archives/2122" target="_blank">“Anatomy”</a> / by: Valerie Wetlaufer (poetry in <em>The Journal</em>)<br />
Birds and the body. Gorgeous language. Even the form attempts flight right out of this poem.</p>
<p>“My best lines to you are composed on vellum, the skin of a stillborn lamb. / I scrape the hide clean, / remove the hairs and rub it smooth with pumice.”</p>
