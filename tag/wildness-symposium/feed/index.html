<p style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><i style="font-size: 13px;"></i>Friday, March 29<sup>th</sup>, 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">9th Annual Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness &amp; the Environmental Imagination: The Future of Water</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Sherwin Bitsui </b>is<i><b> </b></i>from White Cone, Arizona, on the Navajo Reservation. He currently lives in New Mexico. He is Dine of the Todich’ii’nii (Bitter Water Clan), born from the Tl’izlani (Many Goats Clan). He holds a BA from the University of Arizona and an AFA in Creative Writing from the Institute of American Indian Arts. Recent honors include: 2011 Native Arts &amp; Culture Foundation Arts Fellowship, 2011 Lannan Foundation Literary Fellowship, the 2010 PEN Open Book Award, an American Book Award, and a Whiting Award. He is the author of <i>Shapeshift</i> (University of Arizona Press, 2003) and <i>Flood Song</i> (Copper Canyon Press, 2009).</p>
<p>When Sherwin Bitsui came to Iowa State to speak at our Annual Wildness Symposium, <em>Flyway</em>&#8216;s Managing Editor Michelle Donahue had the opportunity to talk with him about his poetry.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>There are so many things I find fascinating about both <i>Shapeshift </i>and <i>Flood Song</i> but I think what was most intriguing was its form and length. In <i>Shapeshift </i>you have these tiny, short poems,while <i>Flood Song</i> is a book-length poem. What made you want to write a book-length poem? What sorts of decisions were involved there? And how was it different writing a book-length poem as opposed to individual poems?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Well, <i>Shapeshift</i> was my first book, so I entered with short pieces and I entered poetry in that way. There is a longer poem in <i>Shapeshift</i> called “The Northern Sun,” which is rather expansive, but it sticks to a three-page, prose-poem format. But then I also realized that I was writing in sections. I was writing shorter poems, but in sections. For some reason that seemed a little more true to my experience. I looked at my poetry and realized that somehow the white space or the negative space also informed the poem. And there needed to be silence between the pieces, so in <i>Shapeshift</i> there was that tendency to number a section, but it was still somehow contained within the poem. With <i>Flood Song</i> it seemed like the poem wanted to be expansive and it wanted to flood the horizon or the valley in which it was written. So the shape of <i>Flood Song</i> is really the shape of the flood. And it’s not a linear shape, it does move in many directions but the gravitational pull of the earth definitely is a direction in which the flood moves towards. In <i>Flood Song</i> there is movement but it is created by the world around it. The world created the reality that I’m in. I just had to follow it.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: So that flooding motion, is that why you chose to format it the way you did? The book has slightly wider pages and you space the passages of the poem very sparsely on the page sometimes. Is that feeding into that flooding movement? What made you decide that that was the right form for the poem?</p>
<p>Bitsui: There were moments where there was compression in the work and this adds to the musicality of the work. Sometimes a poem is so loaded with images and it is so compressed that it somehow blurs in the mind. I was interested in this idea of blurring and smearing because I’m also a visual artist. So I enacted that as a part of my process. Could I create this poem where I loaded the images on top of each other and they are going to collapse and on the following page they are going to be expansive again. Those came intuitively. I don’t think I did it conceptually. I think it just formed in that matter and I just followed it.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: Speaking of you being a visual artist, I noticed that you were the artist behind the cover art of <i>Flood Song</i>, which is this beautiful abstract, colorful painting that you’ve named “Drought.” So how do you think that art, “Drought” interacts with this poem, <i>Flood Song</i>?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Well, maybe they both create the same effect or feeling within the body in a way. Because I’ve been through drought, I’ve noticed my incredible longing for water. Not just for myself, but for the animals that we tended to and for the land. I was really aware of it as a young child. So the painting itself read the way that I read my poem <i>Flood Song</i>. If you noticed the smearing on the edges and its leading to something on the top right corner. Certainly I imagined that was an image of the flood. But it’s called “Drought.” Maybe “Drought” is flooding and maybe that’s the real poem. The image resonated with the intensity of <i>Flood Song.</i></p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: I wanted to talk a little about the Navajo language. I know you speak Navajo, but was it your first language? Or did you grow up speaking both Navajo and English?</p>
<p>Bitsui: It’s hard to say. I feel like Navajo is my first language. Diné Bizaad is my first language. But English was always spoken also. I think for up until I was five, Navajo was primarily spoken. Maybe I spoke a little bit of English. I don’t remember. But it wasn’t until I got to elementary school, middle school, and high school where my language really took a back seat to English; mainly when I went to school off the reservation in a public school in a border town. As a speaker of the Navajo language you didn’t speak it, because it wasn’t appreciated not just by other peers but also by the people in the education system.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: I read that you described the Navajo language as “complex and dense” and a language that brings out the sacredness in things, so how do you think growing up with this language influences the way you interact with English, primarily with your poetry?</p>
<p>Bitsui: I think speaking and being with another culture at a young age, I responded to a lot of our cultural perspectives regarding language. Navajo is very imagistic and descriptive and also very verb driven; everybody in my family spoke metaphorically about things and they spoke poetically about things. The notion of speaking and speaking well has an honorable place in the Navajo community. I saw this attention given to speakers at a very young age and I was made to speak publicly in family settings. So there was always this respect for language and craft and it fed into poetry naturally, it wasn’t ever outside of that.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: So with the title, <i>Flood Song</i> and many of the passages of it, the work reminded me of Whitman with all of his “Song of…” poems. Was that an influence you were aware of when you were writing? What poets do you think your works are influenced by? Were you actively in conversation with any poet(s)?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Not so much with <i>Flood Song</i>. In <i>Shapeshift</i> there is. There are some moments when Whitman is in conversation with me, or I’m in conversation with him. Not intentionally. I feel like I didn’t really have a floor. I couldn’t really hook it onto anything that was obvious to me. The only poet that I was in conversation with was probably my own traditional songs. Somehow I was trying to speak to the voices of before and the way they constructed their poems. It is a very voice-driven work and there is a visionary appeal to it, but there wasn’t really anyone that I could see. And I could see the long lines and the long breath reference that certain poets that have come before me use. I’m okay with that. I’m okay with those references, but the poem really grew out of this time and for whatever reason it did grow. And if there are influences, then I wasn’t trying to write “Song of Myself 2.0” or something. This poem was really born out of its time and for whatever reason, as poets we return to that form, whatever collisions occur, and then those poems emerge. I think Shermen Alexie, on the book jacket as a blurb, said he heard Whitman in these poems or he heard Ginsberg, so I won’t deny that aspect, but I don’t think I was reading them against each other when I was composing it, because the poems were written out of intuition and dreaming and trying to find a new way to speak to the present. But there still always is going to be an old way of speaking to any present. Anywhere.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: You mentioned earlier when you were writing <i>Flood Song</i> there was a sonic nature. Is that how you usually write poetry? How did you craft <i>Flood Song</i>—what steps did you go through to get it in its final state?</p>
<p>Bitsui: I wrote pieces of it and there was a balkanization of these pieces and they formed their own countenance and they broke up and they shifted with the time, whichever time I was in. Eventually I had a collection of work that didn’t belong within the short format poem structure. A lot of the reason why I built this long poem is simply because what had to be said, had to be said the way it’s going to be said. Also, even if I think about traditional Navajo songs or poems, poem-songs, they do operate in a very lengthy way. They are drawn out by the speaker who operates or recreates these poems from memory. So, the sonic quality is followed simply because it was comfortable for me to hear my poem spoken back to me. A lot of the process was giving the poems to anyone within an arms distance at some point and having them read my poem to myself. A section or maybe the whole poem. I composed it by ear. I also composed it in a way where, if the poem was in anybody’s voice, they would alter the poem with their own breath and I would listen for those nuances and I would listen for those line breaks that they were making. I would see if it worked or not. So the poem was really created by different people in a way. I wrote the words, but everybody altered the poem with their own voice at some point. Ultimately, I’m the one who created it, but I listened to how people responded to it. These were just people, not poets. Just anybody who would sit near me. I was this eccentric poet asking, “Hey, could you read this little piece for me?”</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: There’s such a sense of celebration, but also of tragic loss in <i>Flood Song</i>. For instance, you have, “where whale ribs / clasp and fasten you to a language of shifting ice” (11), an idea of moving land and losing land. You have lines that directly speak to loss, but also deal a lot with loss of sight or obstruction of sight with lines like: “I cover my eyes with electrical wires” (12), and “I bite my eyes shut between these songs” (4). How do you think loss plays out in <i>Flood Song</i>? Is it ultimately a balance between drought and flood? How did you think of loss when you were writing this? Or was that even conscious?</p>
<p>Bitsui: Probably unconscious. I don’t think I set out to write a poem about loss, it just emerged within the writing of the work. And all of those things were revealed later on. Also, I think someone once said, “All nature poetry is now elegy.” That was a recent quotation I had read, and wasn’t something I heard before writing this, but I thought it was interesting that we’re looking at nature and we’re imposing something on it that is somehow finite. It discontinues. But really it will continue and move forward. So <i>Flood Song,</i> I think is not so much about loss, but is a poem that exists in its time. And loss happens in time. But time moves past and births arrive. So there is that aspect to it; it accepts those things in a way that I personally can’t as a human being because I’m connected to things that I am connected to in a very familial way. I think I’m in a place now that even my language feels that it’s not being replanted in the voices of children. There is a kind of loss there too. But people are trying to teach the language in immersion schools, so there is hope. These things occur simultaneously. So all of that is a part of it. We’re moving so fast in all directions. I come from such a place that has been the root of my being for a millennia. How can you just move into this new world so easily? I question all of the things that are being lost. So, it’s a transitory piece and it’s a migrating piece. It’s very difficult to have to keep your foot in both worlds at the same time because you’ll be weighed down by the responsibilities that incur.</p>
<p><i>Flyway:</i> So when you wrote that wonderful line, “I map a shrinking map” is that a map of everything? Land, language, a way of life? Or did you have something more specific in your mind?</p>
<p>Bitsui: It’s probably a metaphorical map in a way. Or maybe it’s a psychic map. It’s definitely a map, maybe of language, which is shrinking. So many of our ideas are based on mapping and knowing and the taxonomy of knowing reality. Taxonomizing an experience. I really think one is shrinking and the need to map it also is the act of making it immortal and making it real for some other person to come to it and see the place that is imagined.</p>

<p><strong>Elizabeth Bradfield</strong> is the author of two poetry collections: <em>Approaching Ice</em> and <em>Interpretive Work</em>. Her poems have appeared in <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>Orion</em>, <em>The Believer</em>, <em>Poetry</em> and are forthcoming in <em>Drunken Boat</em>, <em>Alaska Quarterly Review</em> and elsewhere. She has been awarded the Audre Lorde Prize and a Stegner Fellowship, among other honors. Founder and editor-in-chief of Broadsided Press, she lives on Cape Cod and works as a naturalist and teacher.  She is the current Poet-in-Residence at Brandeis University.</p>
<p>In March, <em>Flyway</em>’s nonfiction editor Lindsay Tigue had the chance to sit down with Elizabeth Bradfield, who was in town for Iowa State University’s Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness, and the Creative Imagination.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: In your bio, you describe yourself as a “poet and naturalist.” As a naturalist participating in marine field research and in-field presentations, you also describe yourself as an “aspiring generalist.” Can you explain a little bit how you see those terms working?</p>
<p>EB: I work as a naturalist in multiple ways. I work locally on Cape Cod on short, three-hour whale watches and that’s very clear cut, but the other naturalist work I do is on expedition ships—ecotourism—so I’m with a team of other naturalists and we travel with people from a week up to three weeks in places like Alaska, the Amazon, Antarctica, and the Arctic. The “aspiring generalist” part comes in because all the naturalists I work with have their expertise and my training is not in science. I came into this work through the back door. It was always my interest though, and in college I studied marine biology, but didn’t end up with the paper to prove it. In the field, before working as a naturalist, I helped out with various projects. I spent a lot of time in the marine environment, in particular with marine mammals. And so now, the more I think about it, the less interested I am in claiming an expertise. Because I feel like the more I look, the more mystified I am. For instance, studying whales got me really interested in pelagic birds.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: It gives you a wider scope.</p>
<p>EB: Yeah. So, what I’m interested is everything (laughs). It’s the culture. It’s the nature. It’s the birds. It’s the whales. It’s the lichen. It’s the tundra ecosystem. It’s the barnacles. It’s the nudibranchs. The reason I’m interested in both poetry and natural history is I don’t want to weight them differently. They’re all interesting to me. They’re all important. And if I throw them into the big jumble and allow them to tumble around in there, then it gets interesting to me. If I try and limit myself too much and say, “I am looking at entanglement rates of gray seals on haul outs of Cape Cod.”—Yeah, I’m interested in that, but I’m not a narrow-focused kind of gal.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: It doesn’t satisfy your curiosity for everything else?</p>
<p>EB: Yeah, I’m like the dog in <em>Up</em>, looking at the squirrels. “Squirrel! There’s a squirrel over there!” My attention is distracted by something else. I want to honor that distraction, that desire to be a more traditional naturalist and person in the world—a generalist. I think being a generalist is a wonderful thing and I think in our society, we are moving toward specialization. In the medical field you see it. You also see it in other fields as well—certification programs for this, that, and the other thing. I am much more interested in <em>not</em> being certified and doing things that I’m interested in. It’s a very selfish desire! I’m doing what I want to do.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: So then my next question is how do you balance or pinball between being a poet and a naturalist?</p>
<p>EB: Awkwardly (laughs). Awkwardly. I like being a spy. Having a secret life. Here I am sitting with you and talking about poetry and, in my secret life, I’m thinking about gray seals. And when I’m in the field as a naturalist, talking about gray seals or whales or birds, then my secret life is being a poet. I don’t do both at once very well and I’ve tried to integrate them and recently I’ve been able to give a couple of talks that address that kind of jumble, talking about, in particular, Arctic science and the poems that have come from that investigation. I think I’ve been able to talk about that because I’ve come into it both as an experienced naturalist and an experienced poet. Immersing myself in the Arctic has been a place where I’ve been able to combine the two a lot more successfully. But when I’m working as a naturalist, I’m not writing poems and when I’m working on poems I don’t want to think like a naturalist per se. I want to think a lot more loosely and have language rather than consequence be at the forefront. So, I seesaw.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What role does research play in your work, if most of it is more hands-on field research or if you do a lot of book research as well? Did your research process change or differ between <i>Interpretive Work</i> and <i>Approaching Ice</i>?</p>
<p>EB: Honestly, in a weird way, I see those two first books as my one first book. A lot of the poems were written concurrently. <em>Interpretive Work</em> was finished first and accepted first and there were a few things I needed to finish up before <em>Approaching Ice</em> became a complete manuscript. Really, though, there were many years when these poems were both moving forward and accumulating and rumbling around.</p>
<p>There are two really different modes for me composing poetry manuscripts. I find myself now in a similar position. I have two manuscripts that I’m working on, one is closer to completion and the other is a little bit further away. One is more from daily life and personal experience, which is true of <em>Interpretive Work</em> and the other is more driven by a concept, a research project, some of the research being book research, some of the research in this case, unlike <em>Approaching Ice</em>, being more like investigative journalism, going to places and experiencing things. I don’t want all of those things in the same book, but I like having a project that I can move forward with, however long it takes me—five years, ten years. You know, I am working on poems about polar exploration and then these other things kind of come in and suddenly I realize, “Oh wow, I have a lot of these. Maybe they are a book…. What are they saying? What’s going on with those?”</p>
<p><em>Fyway</em>: When you’re beginning a new poem, where does the idea come from? How long of a writing process goes into each poem, or does it vary?</p>
<p>EB: I used to say—and it used to be true—that it was sound. A first line of a poem would come to me and it would be kind of incantatory and it would stick around in my head and I had to follow it. That still happens to me sometimes, but I feel like as poets it’s our job to be tuning forks, right? To be ready to resonate in one way, shape, or form. What I am interested in now are the moments of resonance that are deeply strange. I overhear something, or see something, or read something, and think, “Wow, that is really weird and a little bit messed up.” That, to me, is an exciting moment for a poem. Something I can’t wait to come home and tell my partner about: “Can you believe this?” There’s shock, uncertainty, and curiosity in a confusing, emotional jumble. Those are the exciting materials to work with in poetry.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Does it ever happen for you that what starts the poem ends up getting cut from the final version?</p>
<p>EB: Oh yes. Definitely. Some poems—a lot of poems for me—take a very long time to write. That doesn’t mean I sit down every day and work on them, but the time that I put a poem in a drawer and leave it for a month or a year, that’s important too, that sitting there and being there and letting other things happen in my life and then pulling that poem out of the metaphoric drawer and looking at it again and seeing if it still feels fresh and it still has the surprise and the weight that it felt like it did when I first wrote it. That time away is really critical for me in my writing process. Very few poems fall right onto the page.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: So it can vary, but for the most part you have to give poems a little space and come back to them?</p>
<p>EB: Space and time. I’m slow. Slow, slow, slow!</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: When reexamining your poems throughout the process of writing your two published books and your works-in-progress, how do you feel you’ve evolved as a poet? When you go back and read earlier work has anything changed in the way you approach both individual poems and large-scale projects?</p>
<p>EB: That’s a really good question. I think it’s easier—well, it’s easy to draw parallels between Book A and Book B and Book 1 and Book 2. So, if Book A is <em>Interpretive Work</em>, the collection that I’m finishing now, that I think is going to be titled <em>Once Removed</em>. Those feel in conversation to me and what’s changed from <em>Interpretive Work</em> to <em>Once Removed</em> is an interest in coldness. I mean coldness not as in a temperature the body feels, but in terms of tone. I’m not allowing my vulnerable and romantic self to be the main speaker, but my more cynical self. I’m still looking at engagements of the human and the natural world, the social self and the biological self, and how that’s all muddy and messed up. I’m still looking at family and place in the world, but with a colder eye.</p>
<p>The poems of <em>Approaching Ice</em> were very armchair-traveler poems. With this new book, I want to have a lot more at stake personally. The poems of <em>Approaching Ice</em> were the poems of an obsession. I was obsessed with this polar travel and why they did it. I didn’t have any skin in the game. I hadn’t really traveled very much to either pole. I hadn’t traveled to Antarctica at all; I’d spent a little bit of time in the north. Now I’ve spent more time there and I want to write about my own experiences more directly set against the explorers and not just judge them and imagine them, but try and have a real and felt contrast between the two.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What poets have influenced you? What contemporary poets’ work currently excites you?</p>
<p>EB: I was very lucky as an undergraduate to study with Linda Bierds. You never know when things are going to converge, but she for me is an amazing role model and poet. She was someone I had a natural resonance with, the way that she worked and the way that she approached poems. I admire her so tremendously. She’s a touchstone for me.</p>
<p>I have huge admiration for Eavan Boland—for her intellectual clarity and the grace of her lyric. Recently, I’ve been reading Stephen Dunn quite a bit and I love his hard-boiled vulnerability, the blend of cranky and romantic that he finds in his work. Anyone who can write a villanelle about Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan wins in my book. I think that’s fantastic.</p>
<p>Those are poets that are important to me and there are so many others. There are so many. Philip Larkin. Not all of his work, but some of it I find really stunning. Coleridge was really important to me as a younger writer. T. S. Eliot.</p>
<p>And now, recently, books that have just knocked my socks off have been Maurice Manning’s <em>Bucolics</em>, I think that’s a stunning book. Also, Cecily Parks’ book <em>Field Folly Snow</em>. Amazing, amazing book. I’ll read anything that Carl Phillips writes. I’ll buy all of his books. I always want to know what he’s up to. And I’ve been loving—I don’t know that they’re in a collection yet—but I’ve been really blown away by the recent work I’ve bee seeing by Ellen Bryant Voigt in <em>The New Yorker</em>. I don’t often respond to poems in <em>The New Yorker</em>, but she’s been doing these amazing, dense, winding, syntactical poems, that I just love.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: In an interview you did with Connotation Press, you said living in Alaska made you realize how important the “edge of roadlessness is to [you], how wonderful it is to walk in places where wild animals like bears and moose are present and demand your attentive respect.” I thought, since you are visiting for the Wildness Symposium, I wonder if you can talk a little bit more about your relationship to “wildness” and how it informs your work.</p>
<p>EB: I think that idea of the world demanding attention is an important one. I think this is why I enjoy spending time on boats. If you don’t pay attention to the weather, you’re an idiot. You really need to pay attention otherwise you can get into deep trouble. And that sense that you can’t enter the interior fully if you’re not attentive, you’ll become physically endangered.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What I notice for instance about being on a boat is that you focus in on different things, your ability to pay attention changes in different wild places.</p>
<p>EB: Yes.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: I just really liked that idea of demanding “attentive respect.” I think that’s something we think about a lot here in terms of, “What is wilderness, and how do you know when you’re in it?”</p>
<p>EB: Yeah and living now on Cape Cod and away from Alaska, it’s all about the water. In the woods, the predators are different. The predators are ticks and Lyme disease; they’re not bear and moose. That’s a different kind of attentiveness, but because that spit of land is so vulnerable—because it’s all sand, because it sticks out there into the Atlantic like a sore thumb, because it’s dangerously low in terms of sea level, weather and climate become their own wildness. They demand that attention. Anything in which your attention is yanked back to the physical present is wildness; whether that’s urban, or rural, or untrammeled.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: I wanted to talk a little about your editorial venture, Broadsided Press. In an earlier interview, you described it as a “literary/visual collaborative grassroots/virtual press.” Can you explain that a little? What role do you envision the combination of visual art and poetry serving?</p>
<p>EB: (laughs) It’s a long slash definition, right? I started the press in a large part out of envy. (laughs) Envy for the tools and the play and the visuals of visual art. I feel that entering an artist’s studio and they’ve got all those little rolled up tubes of paint and boxes of things—</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: It’s so tactile.</p>
<p>EB: (nods) —and you never know how it’s going to be used, but there’s this visual richness of things you can play with. If you enter a writer’s room, sure you’ll have some pictures and maybe some notebooks, but it’s boring.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Sheafs of paper (laughs).</p>
<p>EB: Yes, it’s not visible. It can be so fun to enter that visual landscape. Poetry, for me, is so important as a way of understanding the world, as a way of making sense of emotion and politics and strange moments in our lives and yet (and I think maybe this is becoming less so), it’s so shut off into a cordon of “highfalutin-ness.” That breaks my heart and I don’t think it should be that way. People are not afraid of art like they are of poetry. How can art help poetry be heard? And how can poetry inspire artists? What I wanted was to show how these forms can reverberate against each other. So the press really started because I wanted to see what visual artists would do with poems—“God, what would someone do with one of my poems? What would they see? What might happen and how can I get poetry into our visual culture in a way that will make someone stop like a poster for a band or an advertisement might?”</p>
<p>So it came from that and then also increasingly, we’ve been doing “Collaborators Q&amp;A,” where we ask the writer and the artist (who have no input over the final product once they send their stuff into me). I wanted to know how it felt to respond, to be responded to. What happens when the two come together, does it change? Is there some kind of shift that happens when the two are resting together visually on the page?</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: The MFA program here at Iowa State is unique in the fact that it is a program in creative writing and environment, which allows us students to explore interdisciplinary subjects relating to the environment that interest us, whether science, art, architecture, history. What are some of your favorite “environmental” writers? How or if you define an “environmental” writer, or would you?</p>
<p>EB: That’s a big question. Well, there are so many that I feel so indebted to. I was talking about Charles Scammons with one of the other students here. He’s an environmental writer I’m super interested in. There’s this wonderful new book out by Eva Saulitis that I’m reading, <em>Into Great Silence: A Memoir of Discovery and Loss among Vanishing Orcas</em>. I think Carl Safina does amazing books. I think Scott Weidensaul’s <em>Living on the Wind</em> is an amazing history of bird migration. I’m all over the map.</p>
<p>I’m more subject-driven when it comes to environmental reading then author-driven. When I think about writers who I really admire in terms of how they formulate a question. Richard Nelson who wrote <em>The Island Within</em> and also <em>Heart and Blood</em> about the lives of white-tailed deer in North America. I think he’s a really interesting writer because he allows the complexity to be there and he also—I think sometimes with nonfiction and environmental writing there becomes this valorization as the self as character moving through understanding and I’m very suspicious of that. I’m interested in the writers who sidestep that one way or another.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Recently, I was at the AWP conference, in the panels and readings I went to, the theme of community and its importance to poetry came up again and again—how crucial it is for fellow poets to share poems and a love of poetry and how the work of a poet can at times feel isolating, as it is work that often sees little audience beyond other poets. This is something I have been thinking a lot about lately myself, how I will retain a poetry community after the shelter of an MFA program. I am wondering what role a larger poetic community plays in your work and in your life as a poet?</p>
<p>EB: I think that idea of the journey of retreat and return in wilderness writing is also true for me in poetry. I rarely share work in progress. I have a lot of friends who are writers and talking with them generally about what we’re working on, what we’re struggling with, what we’re going to do, is really important, to feel like I have peers engaged in the work. But I don’t often look for feedback until pretty far along in the process because I think that solitude of being with the work and not having an outside influence too soon is really important to me, to be able to tumble it around and kick it, and pull it apart and put it back together—</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: On your own.</p>
<p>EB: On my own. It’s important to me. I enjoy that process. I don’t want that taken away from and I don’t want someone else’s imprint on it too soon. I need the shape to be a little more firm. A writing community is really important to me, but not poem-by-poem. The sense that there are other people out there engaged in the work is almost one of the most important things.</p>
<p>And then there’s this other excitement that happens like when you’re at a conference like AWP, the ASLE conference, Bread Loaf, or Sewanee. A gathering of writers. When those people come together and there’s that energy of all those people bringing forward their concerns and starting to see trends in the conversation, whether it’s aesthetic or subject, that’s really fascinating, too. And I love to immerse in that and then run away.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: (laughs) I definitely felt like that after AWP this year.</p>
<p>EB: Oh, it’s overwhelming, right? The running away is important, too.</p>

<p><b>Julia Whitty’s</b> latest book <i>Deep Blue Home: An Intimate Ecology of our Wild Ocean </i>was a <i>Washington Post </i>Best of Nonfiction Book of 2010. Her previous book <i>The Fragile Edge: Diving &amp; Other Adventures in the South Pacific </i>was the recipient of the John Burroughs Medal Award for Outstanding Natural History Book, the PEN USA Award for Creative Nonfiction, the Kiriyama Prize for Nonfiction, and the 2008 Northern California Book Awards for Creative Nonfiction. Whitty’s fiction, collected in her debut book <i>A Tortoise for the Queen of Tonga</i>, received an O. Henry Award and has appeared in <i>Harper’s, The Paris Review, Zoetrope, </i>and <i>Story</i>. Her environmental correspondence for <i>Mother Jones</i> has been anthologized the <i>Best American Science Writing 2011. </i>Whitty is a former filmmaker whose more than seventy nature documentaries have aired on PBS, Nature, The Discovery Channel, and National Geographic.</p>
<p>When Julia visited Iowa State University for the 9<sup>th</sup> Annual Wildness Symposium, we were lucky enough to spend a few days talking to her about oceans, the art of writing as activism, and the many ways in which science, spirituality, and the everyday world interconnect.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>My first introduction to your work was the story “A Tortoise for the Queen of Tonga,” which I read when it was anthologized in <i>Prize Stories 1999: The</i> <i>O. Henry Awards.</i> The tortoise itself, the story of it, you talk a little bit about in <i>Deep Blue Home</i> too—what was it about Tu’i Malila that made you want to tell that story?<ins cite="mailto:English" datetime="2013-04-15T18:37"> </ins><i></i></p>
<p>JW: Well for me it was the realization that this tortoise, which lived for 200 years, witnessed one of the most critical 200 years in the history of this island, where everything changed. You had one human culture that was suddenly more or less invaded by another human culture, and all of the natural systems were impacted, and I thought: to tell a story in a 200-year span from the point-of-view of one tortoise witnessing it, that immediately intrigued me. I also really like messing with time when I write. I like to telescope huge spans into short stories, and tiny spans into full-length things. I like to do the opposite with time. That was what really intrigued me.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>Yeah, I think that was one of the coolest parts about that story, too, just thinking of narrative structures. You’re not giving these really strict, firm points of reference because it’s still from the tortoise, but I loved getting to know the new royalty that she’s interacting with. It was a beautiful story. I read the rest of the collection in Utila, Honduras in January. “Darwin in Heaven” was wonderful, and “Lucifer’s Alligator”—the one from the perspective of the marine aquarium animals, their sort of revolt. How do you pick point-of-view when you’re writing stories, fiction-wise?</p>
<p>JW: I know that in short fiction, which I haven’t written in quite awhile, but when I was working on that collection, I almost always got a title first. And from the title, I got the voice. I spent so much of my life working on nature documentaries, spent vast quantities of life staring at animals doing their thing, trying to capture it on film, and lots and lots of time of animals <i>not</i> doing their thing, or waiting for animals to do their thing, or hoping they’ll do it, and that period just sort of freed my imagination to go wherever it wants to go. I always got the title, and often I’d get the first sentence. And from there, the story would unspool from its own momentum, the sentence guided the voice. It was that “<i>not</i>-planned,” frankly.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>Do you have similar subconscious response when writing nonfiction too, or is that a different impulse?</p>
<p>JW: Yeah, I actually do. I’ve learned of late to be a lot more targeted, because I write in more journalistic form, although it’s long form and different and more creative, but I have traditionally let myself follow these currents, the way I think of it. They curlicue and eddy and do strange things, and I have no idea where they’re going. I feel it’s all-magical where they take me. I’ve never been someone who writes to an outline, or even a particularly well-developed idea, but I’ve become more so in an attempt to become a higher word output writer.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>Needing that structure to keep going that way.</p>
<p>JW: But that’s not what I like. I like the currents, the serendipitous discoveries and the feeling of connectedness that you couldn’t possibly have planned for, that’s what gets me. A day with that in the writing is a day that’s made me happy.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>I think your nonfiction definitely reads like that. I mean, one of the most engaging parts of it for me—in <i>Deep Blue Home</i> and to a similar extent in <i>The Fragile Edge</i>—you’re bringing in ideas of spirituality and philosophy, threading this idea of <i>rasa</i> and the river around the world and the many other multiplicitous meanings of that word. You start <i>Deep Blue Home </i>on Isla Rasa and go from there. It’s sort of a Pandora’s box of all of these things you could put in there, so how do you pick?</p>
<p>JW: Ultimately, I let a later stage, another draft [decide for me]. I sort of employ a different brain. I also think of it like, “Now I’m being an editor. Now I put on my editor’s hat.” I let that brain choose which ones make it in, and I recycle a lot. Stuff that got chucked out of one manuscript, I’ll be in a pinch when I’m working on something else, and I think, “Well I wrote something that I can sort of slot right in here.” I’m a great fan of recycling my own writing. And I save everything, good, bad or indifferent, and I hope I can salvage it. Do something with it.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>What is it for you about the spiritual aspects? Why are you so inclined to link that to the ecology and the scientific world? What is it that pulls those two things together for you?</p>
<p>JW: Well I think it’s all part of the same questions. The science questions are the same as the philosophical and metaphysical questions. All the same questions, using different tools. But I believe that part of our human progress is that we’re honing in toward a common answer. These things are coming closer, rather than further apart. And so that’s what’s happening now in the 21<sup>st</sup> century particularly, a reintegration of things that were very disparate in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. I like helping connect those dots, if there’s anyway to do that, even within my own thinking. When you have a question, you search around for tools, and I don’t rule out any tools—I’m happy to use whatever. Hammer, wrench, or saw will work. I naturally start investigating tool sets of everything I can possibly figure out or understand, and eventually help to build the house, whatever the house is, the house we live in.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>You said yesterday at dinner that you would like to be, in another life, a linguist—what would that next dream project be for you? What is something that you haven’t worked on yet, that if someone called you up tomorrow and said, “I’m doing this_____” you would jump on it?</p>
<p>JW: Most of what I write in nonfiction ends up being big picture, and so that’s sort of what I do. I have a lot of big picture stories that I’d like to write, but I suspect there’s not enough people interested in them to make them work. So then I feel—more than anything, what I feel at this stage in my life—I feel the shortage of time. If I could have anything more, I would have a really long lifespan, so that I could keep pursuing these things. It might take me five or ten years to do a project like that, but I only have a few bunches of those decades left, I don’t have many of those decades left, and as a working writer, you look realistically at your writing lifespan, and you become a lot more targeted. What are you going to spend your time doing?</p>
<p>When you’re young, you think, “I can write about everything eventually,” and then one day, you wake up and go, “Wow, I will never be able to…” When I was young, I was absolutely certain I would get to go into space in my lifetime, and there was a point where I realized, “You know—</p>
<p>crap—I’m not gonna get to go into space.” I was really disappointed, I thought it sucked. I actually started working on a short story, which I’ve never finished—although I may someday—which I call “First Writer in Space,” because I thought, “If I can’t do it, I can imagine it. If NASA sent a writer up, what would they write, what would it be?”</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>What would they notice that the astronauts wouldn’t?</p>
<p>JW: Yes. Because a writer is going to report things absolutely differently, that’s what we do. We’re a different eye, we’re always a far outsider eye, an outlier-eye on the world around us. So, more time is what I wish I had. One of those tortoise life spans.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>You could be Tu’i Malila.</p>
<p>JW: Yeah.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>One of my favorite anecdotes from <i>Deep Blue Home</i> is when you’re working with bathypelagic worms, <i>losing</i> a new species, and then the researcher doing something very similar a few days later. What have your experiences in working so closely with the scientists been like? You, not as the scientist but as the writer, doing something similar to being the writer on the moon, but instead you’re the writer in the submersible, or the writer on the boat.</p>
<p>JW: It’s really different depending on who the researchers are. When you’re on research cruises, there’s a personality that is the cruise, and it’s a result usually of who the chief scientists aboard are, and the sort of structure they create and the people they’ve brought along. They’re radically different. The thing about going to sea in a ship for any length of time at all is that you create a closed ecosystem that is its own world. The outside world doesn’t happen. And if nothing else, it’s a fascinating thing to be part of this ephemeral closed ecosystem, that just exists for the duration of this cruise and then it’s gone. Depending on the personality of the principal investigators, sometimes it’s multiples these days, that will radically affect how I interact and what I come away with, how much hands-on I get or don’t get, how much they let me in or don’t let me in. That’s a big part of it.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>If you had to choose a favorite marine organism: air, sea, bird, diatom, what would it be?</p>
<p>JW: I can’t even begin to answer that kind of a question. I find everything basically equally fascinating. Because if it’s not fascinating, it just means we don’t even know enough about it yet. That’s why we’re not fascinated, because we haven’t learned the really bizarre, fascinating things about it. Increasingly, I’ve come to see an isolated species is irrelevant, it’s the movement within the ecosystem, it’s the flow of energy between organisms, the interaction with inanimate things. That level is what’s interesting to me, not a species. Even though an individual species can be utterly, completely fascinating.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>I’m coming to realize that, too. I’ve noticed, working with students who are just sort of learning about the ocean or marine ecosystems, that they have a lot trouble connecting because they just can’t envision being in that kind of environment. It’s so disparate from how we function, you know, we can’t even be in the ocean without the help of artificial machines and things like that. How do you think writing about the ocean just generally, or when you were making films, how is that helping to bridge that gap for people?</p>
<p>JW: In the beginning of <i>The Fragile Edge</i>, I think I wrote the most succinct thing I’m ever likely to say, which I don’t remember and couldn’t possibly quote, but basically I talk about the challenge of writing about the underwater world. When you go into the underwater world, you don’t speak. You don’t get to speak under there, because you can’t <i>talk</i> underwater, and I believe this affects the way you form memory. I was also struck, from diving, that I would come back with strange hazy memories, because I wasn’t talking about it. When you come up from a dive, you’re usually in this kind of — I don’t know — we don’t have words, we don’t have descriptive words for those things down there, and so we’re in this realm where language is not what we’re operating from. So the struggle for me is trying to translate this experience that happens without language into language. And that has been incredibly fun, and incredibly challenging. In the end, about all you can do is work with metaphor, because we don’t <i>have</i> words for those things, so they are “sea pens” and “sea fans,” and everything has a thing about this world that has nothing to do with that world. We don’t actually have language for that world.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>We can’t echolocate, so you have to explain how that would function. Do you do that differently in fiction and nonfiction? In trying to write about whales in nonfiction, or the orcas in “Lucifer’s Alligator,” how do you change the use of those metaphors?</p>
<p>JW: Not a whole lot definitely. The one thing I do, which some people are so opposed to, I do a lot of anthropomorphizing in fiction. I’m a big fan of anthropomorphizing, because I don’t think we’re so special that we even need that word, frankly. I think, we’re all on the continuum somewhere. So, I think that word is arrogant.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>Yes.</p>
<p>JW: At any rate, I like to do that in fiction. To challenge people’s assumptions about the difference between animals and humans. In nonfiction I can’t quite do that the same way, I have to do that in a more technical fashion, but in a way I’m kind of aiming to do the same thing. A lot of the descriptive writing though can be the same. I was surprised. When I started writing fiction, first of all I wasn’t even sure if I <i>could</i> write fiction. I was like, “Well I don’t know, but I really want to try.” I had been doing films and I’d been writing scripts for documentary films, I did a lot of freelance work where I wrote other people’s [scripts], and I realized I’d been writing scripts almost daily for years and years. Basically in my opinion, playing the scales on the piano, practicing the scales until I was an extremely proficient writer that had learned to be really succinct and short. If you’re writing a script for TV, you can’t take any length of time to say it, it has to be unbelievably targeted.</p>
<p>But I found I could write fiction, and when I had my first fiction starting to be published, I had a lot of editors coming to me and asking if I could write some nonfiction. I went into it not knowing if I could, but I was surprised that it was rather similar. There wasn’t that much difference. Particularly with creative nonfiction and fiction, there’s a lot of shared territory. I mean, in the Venn diagrams, you have the fiction circle and the nonfiction circle, and where they overlap is creative nonfiction. It’s a beautiful ground, I love it in there.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>We talked a little bit about getting to tell the good news, having a good story to tell. I think that can be really difficult, and it’s really hard for me to read, particularly about the ocean and marine environmental issues, without becoming misanthropic. The sonar testing and the whales, the disappearance of any number of species that we didn’t even know existed, the trophic cascades that you talk about, people taking phytoplankton as a layer of the ecosystem for granted. If that disappears, it’ll be catastrophic. Who or what keeps you from despairing when you’re thinking about that kind of problem?</p>
<p>JW: Well it’s hard. It’s hard to not succumb to despair, writing about this kind of stuff. I’ve been living my life, even the films were always this subject matter, and I think the act of writing is an antidote to despair, that’s number one. So that’s a great thing. If you’re feeling despairing, well, communication helps! I covered the BP spill down in the Gulf, and the aftermath of that was a particularly despairing time for me because I felt I really had very high expectations. It might have been a seismic shift where things would have really changed, and then they didn’t. Then we had the Copenhagen thing, where I really, really believed there would be a shift that took place, then and there, and it didn’t happen. I realized, “Wow, these things aren’t happening.” I probably retreated for almost a year, where I had to rearrange my world, where I had to think about how I was going to survive.</p>
<p>I read a seminal paper in a science journal—<i>Trends in Evolution &amp; Ecology</i> called TREE—by these two Aussie researchers who wrote about how conservation science is not doing a good enough job talking about the successes. Consequently, all the science journals are publishing is the doom—saying and the failures and the utter horrors, and what’s happening are policy makers and the public and even the scientists are left thinking, “What’s the point? This is all shit, why even bother? Just live my little life, close the shutters, and don’t think about it.” And they said it’s not accurate. There’s really, really good stuff happening out there. Every one of us in conservation science has good stories. About things we thought were going to go much worse faster and/or forever, and they haven’t. They haven’t done that. What are those stories, and why aren’t they telling them? It was a call to action. I decided I was going to do that.</p>
<p>The next article I wrote called “The Power of One” is where I went to next. I believe we have machinery in place that is despairing and gloomy and dismal, <i>and</i> accurate, but I don’t believe it’s counterweighted properly with the fact that as a species, we’re doing incredible stuff. We’re learning amazing things. We’re adapting to things that are just becoming clear to us. We’re adapting and making changes, shifting course. We need to give ourselves more credit. We need to broadcast these triumphs, and analyze them, and grow them up. All these things, we need to scale up. We can’t live in despair. You can’t live there. There’s nothing to be gained by living there.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>That’s a great answer. I read <i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez </i>[referenced in <i>Deep Blue Home</i>]<i> </i>last summer when I was in California, and it quickly moved into my top five of books. I didn’t even know Steinbeck wrote nonfiction before I came across that. The relationship with Ed Ricketts is beautiful; the appendix at the end, I think, is the most beautiful thing he’s ever written. It’s him just telling stories about this man he worked so closely with. Do you see yourself forming relationships with people like that, who sort of follow throughout your career?</p>
<p>JW: Somewhat yeah, there are some people. I’ve made a point—not exclusively, but I’ve tried— one of my objectives has been to write about women in science, and that’s part of my agenda. So I’ve sought out women in science. And I’ve found honestly, they’re more receptive to letting me come along. Maybe men feel secure enough in their positions that they are not so interested in having what might be a challenging situation, of having a writer tagging along. They’re like, “Eh, I can’t be bothered.” Right? And women for some reason are like, “This could be good, I’m gonna let you come. I don’t know what it’ll lead to.” And you don’t when you let an outsider into your world. So I’ve had a lot of good relationship with women scientists, and I tend to keep connecting with them, and I follow their careers and we give each other feedback. It’s nice.</p>
<p>Of course, things are different than Steinbeck and Rickett’s day. Everything’s faster paced, so much more is happening. He had this one relationship. It’s different now. You have many relationships, and you can just touch base with each other. But it’s good. Maybe not as personally nourishing as Steinbeck had with Ricketts, but it’s professionally very nourishing.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>My students read [Steinbeck’s] introduction and the first chapter [of that book], and they really responded to it well because he’s bringing in humor and some philosophy, but there’s also the science involved and he’s explaining the technicalities of it. From an outsider’s perspective, they could sort of access that world because of the way that he was he’s telling it. I think you do a lot of similar things with science: You’re weaving the Viking stories and the mythology, and then the linguistics, and then the science, the people you’re working with. Is that an intentional thing, or is that just, you know, “I want to talk about all these things and they’re interconnected, so this is what I’m going to give you?”</p>
<p>JW: More the latter. I’m just interested in those things and I’m tracking them down and investigating and rooting around. And I’m finding connections. Actually, what makes me excited is connections. Finding a connection is like finding treasure for me. When I’ve found a connection, that’s just what I live on. Some way that the mythical and the metaphysical, the philosophical, the scientific and the biological worlds connect, that’s just the stuff that makes my blood run. I like that, and I like finding it. I actively look for it. Where they connect and where they overlap, those Venn diagrams. I’m always looking for that overlapping territory.</p>

<p>Iowa State University, <em>Flyway</em>&#8216;s bricks and mortar home, is currently hosting our <a href="http://engl.iastate.edu/programs/creative_writing/mfa/visiting-writers-series/9th-annual-symposium-on-wildness-wilderness-the/" target="_blank">9th Annual Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness &amp; the Environmental Imagination</a>.  This year&#8217;s theme, &#8220;The Future of Water,&#8221; has attracted some of today&#8217;s most important and imaginative writers thinking about our relationship with our planet&#8217;s most essential element.  For our readers who are unable to attend, here&#8217;s a web rove focusing on those writers.  The Symposium wraps up this weekend with a Kinship of Rivers event out at the Casey Nature Preserve on Sunday (April 7th), and a reading on Monday evening (April 8th) featuring authors Rick Bass and Wang Ping.  Come if you can, and if you can&#8217;t, this web rove will give you a taste of the deep, refreshing waters we&#8217;ve been swimming in.</p>
<p>Charles Fishman, excerpts from <a href="http://www.walmarteffectbook.com/excerpts.html" target="_blank"><em>The Wal-Mart Effect</em></a></p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2004, seventy percent of all new retail jobs created in the United States were Wal-Mart jobs.  Wal-Mart shapes where we shop, the products we buy, and the prices we pay — even for those of us who never shop there.  Read excerpts from one of <em>The Economist</em>&#8216;s Best Books of 2006, and decide for yourself how much you should be paying attention to what&#8217;s going on with this mega-corporation.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Bradfield,<i> &#8220;</i><a href="http://www.ebradfield.com/poems/solitude.shtml" target="_blank">Against Solitude</a><i>&#8220;</i></p>
<p>From her collection <em>Approaching Ice</em>, which she read for us at the Wildness Symposium.  This web page has links to some of her other poems, too: some uncollected, some from <em>Approaching Ice</em>, some from <em>Interpretive Work</em>.  &#8220;Against Solitude&#8221; will convince you, no matter how much of a loner you are.</p>
<p>Sherwin Bitsui, &#8220;<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/182473" target="_blank">River</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>The word &#8220;river&#8221; is a verb.  From his collection <em>Shapeshift.</em></p>
<p>Julia Whitty, <a href="http://deepbluehome.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Deep Blue Home</a></p>
<p>Julia Whitty&#8217;s book <em>The Fragile Edge</em> has been described as &#8220;a natural history, a call to action, a love song, and a prayer.&#8221;  Her latest book <em>Deep Blue Home: An Intimate Ecology of our Wild Ocean</em> will change how you think about our oceans.  &#8220;Deep Blue Home,&#8221; linked above, is her blog site.  Also of interest is her latest <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/02/navy-climate-change-great-green-fleet" target="_blank">article in Mother Jones</a> on how the US Navy is reducing energy consumption, decreasing reliance on foreign oil, and significantly increasing the use of alternative energy &#8211; changing the energy game across the globe.  Her <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2010/09/bp-ocean-cover-up" target="_blank">article on the Deepwater Horizon</a><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2010/09/bp-ocean-cover-up" target="_blank"> oil spil</a>l was one of the most important pieces of reporting to come out of that disaster.</p>
<p>Joy Harjo, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/07/09/156501436/joy-harjos-crazy-brave-path-to-finding-her-voice" target="_blank">audio interview discussing </a><em><a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/07/09/156501436/joy-harjos-crazy-brave-path-to-finding-her-voice" target="_blank">Crazy Brave</a> </em>(from NPR&#8217;s &#8220;Talk of the Nation&#8221;)</p>
<p>Multi-talented poet, musician, and muse, Joy Harjo shares some secrets in this audio interview she did with NPR.  The webpage also includes a link to excerpts from her new book <em>Crazy Brave</em>.</p>
<p>Wang Ping, <a href="http://www.kinshipofrivers.org/" target="_blank">Kinship of Rivers project</a></p>
<p>Kinship of Rivers is a five-year interdisciplinary project to build kinship among communities along the Mississippi and Yangtze Rivers, and raise awareness about the rivers&#8217; ecosystems through art, literature, music, food, and the installations of river-flags made by river communities.  Learn about this unique and visionary project and how it&#8217;s inspiring people living on opposite sides of the planet.</p>
<p>Rick Bass, &#8220;<a href="http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/winter-2012/gettysburg" target="_blank">Gettysburg</a>&#8221; (in <em>Narrative</em>)</p>
<p>&#8220;He’s not a fool. He’s foolish, but not a fool. He knows he’s on thin ice, soulwise; he knows that his soul has gone underground for a while, has gone to sleep, but he can’t think of how to wake it up.&#8221;  Access to this short story requires signing up for <em>Narrative</em>, &#8220;a non-profit dedicated to the best in storytelling.&#8221;  Signing up is free, and you get to read a whole lot of really good writing.</p>

<p>Born in Springfield, Missouri, Mr. Daniel Woodrell passed through the Marines, the University of Kansas, the Writer’s Workshop, and a Michener Fellowship, ultimately settling with his wife, novelist Katie Estill, in West Plains, in the Ozarks, the setting for so much of his fiction, a place called the “least governable region in America.”<img class="alignright" title="Daniel Woodrell,

<p>The <em>Chicago Tribune</em>’s review of <em>Winter’s Bone</em> described the prose as, “sentences that could be ancient carvings on a tree.”  Not some petunia-ringed slab of granite on Park Avenue or even Latin scrawl on the Declaration of Independence’s backside.  From his debut novel <em>Under the Bright Lights</em>, Mr. Woodrell rejected big city fiction and the stories of the landed class, a tradition he continues up to his most recent story collection, <em>The Outlaw Album</em>.</p>
<p>His writing is beautiful and sharp and lean with lines that snapped across my chest like the restraints on some demented log ride and then I was off, holding my breath at the sights, ready to take up arms with characters if called upon, lulled into contemplation by the moments just before the next swoop, eventually coming out on the other side knowing I was witness to something great.  Literary fiction without being about people who read literary fiction.</p>
<p>There’s this immense importance in Mr. Woodrell’s work, because it forces the acknowledgement that the lives in his stories, while fiction, are very true.  He gives these people, these Americans, a microphone and it’s our fortune to hear them, to see them struggle with getting it right.</p>
<p>What this all comes down to: The Dollys, the Shades, the addicts, and the Southern bushwackers—the outliers—can trust their stories are done justice when told by their bard.</p>
<p>-*-</p>
<p><strong>Logan Adams</strong>: Starting out with themes in your work—I’ve read some interviews where you bristle at people describing your work as “dark.”  Or maybe not bristle, but disagree with it.  Where do you think that misunderstanding comes from?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Woodrell</strong>: Well, I think I know in my own heart what I think I’m trying to say, and I think of my writing as having little sun breaks in it and so forth, but you really can’t argue if readers don’t see it.  I realize it and I’ve usually expressed that sentiment in a kind of baffled or bemused way more than an argumentative way.  I recognize it, and my wife also calls me dark.  [laughter]  And my editor would as well, so I just don’t think my books are negative, I don’t think they’re defeatist.  And I also think that one reason people think they’re dark is because they have negative endings.  But not all of them do.  You know, you have to make choices as you go through life and I think it’s just as useful a moral lesson to see what happens when you consistently make the wrong choices to show someone virtue triumphs.  So to me it’s moral.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: You once called “dark” as like life, life is dark.  That made a lot of sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: We can’t live in a cotton candy world where we’re not willing to recognize death—friends that have died, relatives are going to die, things are going to go wrong, jobs can be lost, houses are foreclosed.  You may have to save yourself a few times along the course of your life and all these challenges are things I think you need to be prepared for spiritually, not thinking that you’re somehow going to be the one to avoid that all.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Your family comes from the Ozarks and some are originally of French descent, and that’s where The Bayou Trilogy’s setting came from.  You’ve been determined to give people who are now your neighbors in the Ozarks a voice.  Why do you focus on the Ozarks and do you see your motivations for using a certain setting in other authors?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: I’m a huge fan of Faulkner of course, but also William Kennedy’s Albany<em> </em>books.  Especially the first half dozen.  Because in his own voice—and he probably had a lot of influence on my style—I was apeshit for Kennedy at one point.  [laughter]  Who had thought of the spiritual life of Albany before he started doing it?  I’d never read a book set in Albany.  I did not have this plan when I started.  I wrote <em>Give Us a Kiss</em> and it was kind of rolicky and I thought, okay I got that out and had fun with it.  I did not realize I would just continue down the path, and as I did I began to realize, this is your inheritance, this is your legacy.  I think a lot about where the people who settled the Ozarks, where they came from before then, in the United States and from abroad and think, yeah there’s a story that needs to be told.  Aimee [Nezhukumatathil] said, if I don’t say it, who’s going to say it?  I’ve said that many times about the things I write about and the things I hope to write about.  If I don’t tell it, who’s going to tell it?  There’s a French director I like a lot and one of his sayings is, make visible that which without you might never be seen.  I consider that a pretty good credo for approaching what I want to do.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: You just referenced Aimee on the panel and you both talked about the ethical obligations you both feel when writing about a place.  What obligations do you have to the people you write about, if any?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: To tell an honest story and to give it all you got.  I’ve had some complete books, I could’ve published them, but I didn’t.  I just threw them away, because I said it’s a disservice to the overall thing you’re trying to carry—to have an effort that you yourself don’t feel measures up.  I don’t think writers have to have that.  I’ve heard writers, Barry Hannah and others say, you have no requirement to do that.  If you want to do that it’s a good source of energy and drive to do your writing.  I definitely started out as a lefty—I had no politics when I went in the military, shortly after that I had all kinds of politics.  So I’ve always seen writing about poor people and stressful economic circumstances as having a vaguely political underpinning.  Anytime you show impoverished people as full humans, even if they’re horribly flawed humans, there’s a political component.  I’ve always felt this was a way for me to express myself about these people and to quietly have a political—not a Danny political platform—just a human thing.  And it’s also quietly a Christian thing, you know?  [laughter]  Most people don’t think that, but it is.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: I was going to ask you what your role as a writer is, but it sounds like you hit on it right now.  Is that what you see your role being?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: That’s the one I’ve chosen to adopt.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>:  How does your new collection, <em>The Outlaw Album</em>, fit into that role or that obligation toward the people of the Ozarks?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Well the stories are very stark and dark, but I was thinking in terms of murder ballads, hill country ballads, British Isles ballads, and folklore.  And there’s a Russian woman I like a lot—she didn’t really influence the writing of anything—but I’ve started reading her since I was done with this thing.  Lyudmila Petrushevskaya.  She writes little, short gnomic things that have a macabre air to them.  A couple of them have been in the <em>New Yorker</em>, I think.  And that informed this collection.  And also certain kinds of things—the story I’m going to read tonight, at the end of the reading.  For a long time I thought it was going to be a novel, then I actually realized it’s not going to be a novel, at least not now.  And realized it could say most of what I wanted to say in a short story.  So some of them came about that way.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: You spoke earlier about politics.  You write a lot about class.  There are great illustrations of Rene Shade being caught between classes in <em>The Bayou Trilogy</em> and you said <em>Tomato Red</em> was influenced by newspaper articles of lower class whites being killed and police not doing anything.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: A gay man was one of them, too.  And still not solved.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Has anyone been added to these outlier groups in the last five years?  Maybe framing this around your family from the Ozarks as being an example of social mobility over time.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: That’s what my new novel’s really about.  It looks like it’s about something else, but really it’s about how it took turmoil and heartbreak and tragedy to spring them forward, so to speak.  And I’m very excited about going to that road and I’m probably going to do it for a couple books, I think.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Focusing on the social mobility?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Well, yes.  One of the things I think about—I’m going to call it “working class,” although my grandmother who worked and everything, was probably more impoverished than certainly a plumber or something like that.  And then with my father we could say we had a working class household and neighborhood, but he did wear a white shirt to work because he was a salesman.  One of the things about moving up, my mother pushed us, she really pushed us to climb, and one brother did not, he did some time and some stuff and the other brother is an unusually successful businessman.  But as you move up and out of the class you were born into, you were comfortable with, you do leave something behind.  And Americans don’t like to acknowledge that that is part of the deal.  And some of it’s good and some are the things you value that you also leave behind.  There are a lot English writers who write about it very well—Allen Sillitoe and David Storey and those guys.  It’s kind of the thing, especially if you were upper middle class to begin with that you wouldn’t recognize—why would anybody feel a kind of sadness or loss to move out of a 600 square foot box with six people in it.  But you did.  I felt a tremendous confusion when my dad finally graduated college and got promoted and suddenly we weren’t living in the old neighborhood anymore.  We didn’t move up that far, but we did move out of there.  I think part of that is why I write so much about what I write about in my books is to recapture some of those feelings, that sense of neighborhood that which, even though it had all kinds of things wrong with it, you belonged, you felt completely at home there.  None of us were rich and few of us were incredibly poor—we were somewhere in that working range.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: The code that Rene [Shade] struggles with—the wonderful scenes in Tip’s bar where there are all these people sitting around thinking, oh, there’s the cop coming in.  Yet he feels a connection to those people.  He feels a part of Frogtown, but other people see him as the law and Tip has this ambivalent feeling toward him, especially in the beginning of <em>The Bayou Trilogy</em>, though it does evolve.  We see a similar kind of code that comes from a lack of interaction or suspicion toward the outside world in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, as well as in a lot of your other work, but particularly with the Dollys.  It’s really their code that allows that novel to happen.  What is the importance of these codes and how do you try to capture them and use them in your work?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Those codes make a lot of practical sense for those people choosing to lead that way of life.  The Scots and Irish were suspicious people when they first settled the Ozarks.  They didn’t want any sheriffs or anything.  They wanted no government.  That’s part of why the Ozarks developed the way it did.  It has been called the least governable section in America.  And not too long ago.  They didn’t want any of them and that’s why they left Kentucky and said let’s go where there is no civilization and we’ll just live there.  We won’t have order imposed because their experience with that world had been where order was governed by who had the gold and they didn’t have the gold.  They had religious principles, which I could have gotten into today a little bit, where your rightness with God was important, your material standing wasn’t.  It wasn’t laziness or anything—they didn’t see to pursing to every stinking dollar that’s available and that’s not necessarily what their God, as they understand him, would want.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: How do you set up your protagonists to navigate through this world?  Like Ree [Dolly]?  How important is the internal struggle of your characters?  Is this where your stories begin?  Is this what you’re trying to capture?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: I think it’s something more interior than that that’s not completely articulate to me.  But just as your speaking I realize that with Ree and Rene they have that same thing in common.  She’s part of a world she’s fairly ambivalent about and he’s a part of a world and he’s ambivalent in both directions.  What I wanted and one thing I think people like about <em>Winter’s Bone</em> is that it’s a story about a family with a code.  Might not be your code, but it’s a code.  A conservative writer who wrote a review about the book, he said, look, these people have a set of beliefs.  They’re not without beliefs.  It’s not your beliefs.  It’s not what you want to encourage, but they do have them.  It is a culture.  It is a community.  I think that’s one of the things people secretly respond to is that there’s this idea of being in a family where we understand a code and we have this bond with each other and that won’t be broken easily.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: I want to loop back to something you said on the panel that I haven’t read about you saying before.  You said you have a triple or quadruple vision of the Ozarks, so like in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, I wonder how much of this is why you pick up this “dark” label.  Particularly when these places are haunted.  Maybe that’s coming through in this triple or quadruple vision.  Like those contemplative moments where Ree’s reflecting on the stone fences and the ghosts of pioneers.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: When I occasionally get the feeling like I need to be somewhere else, I’ll tell my wife, look, I know my family’s stories, there’s a lot to feel good about, there’s a lot not to feel good about.  There was a lot of pain and poverty and uncles dying because they couldn’t buy medicine and all kinds of <em>Grapes of Wrath</em> kind of thing.  Those all happen there, too, and I said, I walked through this and it ain’t all hearts and flowers, I’m aware of that, too.  That’s all hanging there, too.  So that’s part of the legacy, also, this long struggle and not always triumphant.  Both sides of my family are from there and my mother’s family did substantially better than my father’s family—not hugely, but notably.  Their history’s full of murders and stabbings and one of them was a lawyer and one was a doctor and don’t get crossways with those guys.  [laughter]  And I said, I always find that kind of strange.  My father’s family was always in hard times, but there’s no known violence associated with them.  My mother’s family—her great-grandfather, I guess—was sheriff and his sons were raised comfortably on 1,500 acres and they lost it eventually, but one of them—and I use this in the book, it’s from family legacy—killed a guy in public and had to pay everybody.  But they’re full of violence.  Just full of violence.  It’s as if they had plenty and they just wanted more.  So, my dad I don’t think you could get him to shoot you—maybe if you attacked him. [laughter]  Whereas these guys who had plenty—and that’s one of these oddities of life, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: You’ve talked about spirituality as being this next outlier category you’re thinking about and I’ve heard you talk about some of the groups who have organized in the Ozarks because of this lack of nosiness, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Many of these counties are sparsely populated.  My county’s probably the most populous, but some of them are under 6,000 residents.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: So where do you think this is taking you?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: It’s going to take some development, because I’m not completely conversant with that approach to life.  The deeply spiritual, whether it’s a strange spirituality or not or devotion to a set of afterlife beliefs and everything else.  But I think that’s going to be a slow development.  I realized since just before I wrote <em>Winter’s Bone</em> that I was getting interested in this idea, because I’m aware of how the Catholic church co-opted a lot of pagan rites and adapted them.  I find that fascinating in and of itself.  That’s how some things got there because the pagans weren’t going to give them up.  [laughter]  And as I was saying earlier, I started getting into some of these unusual sects that exist throughout the Ozarks and I wonder how long they’ve existed.  They may go back to that revival in the early 1800s, I don’t know.  I’d sure be curious to find out.  It won’t be easy to.  I’m not great about talking to that crowd.  First off you almost have to declare yourself devoted to them to get a conversation, but I’m ready to poke around and ask some questions to see what I can find out, because I find it very, very interesting.  Even the crazy Phelps group we were talking about from Topeka—hateful, hateful people—they are rock solid.  They have a hard set of rules.  I saw a documentary about them and they excommunicate people for practically nothing.</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Was that the one with the British journalist?</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Yeah.  Doesn’t take much to get them to kick you out.  [laughter]</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Have a strict code, I suppose.  [laughter]</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Yeah, and you&#8217;re dead to them—son, daughter—once you’re out.  That’s a strange thing.  I found myself in a long conversation about the founding of Mormonism last week.  They had a guy that killed enemies of the church and there’s been books written about him.  And then I thought, well I don’t know, but then I thought, who are you kidding, what do you think the Knight Templar were?  [laughter]  At some remove the Presbyterians probably had one and the leftists.  [laughter]  It maybe have been some centuries ago.  [laughter]  And as Oral Hershiser said when he was criticized—he was the Tim Tebow of his day—Christian doesn’t mean wimp, people.  [laughter]</p>
<p><strong>LA</strong>: Well thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: No problem, thank you.</p>
