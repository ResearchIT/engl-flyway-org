								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chilly fall weather and the growing darkness have you huddling inside? Open up the latest edition of <i>Flyway</i> and let the electricity of our new content exhilarate you from head to toe.</p>
<p>Whet your artistic palate with our fresh visual art. Kristi Beisecker creates scintillating photograms by exposing organic objects to electricity and capturing the interaction on photosensitive paper. And take your time with Laurence Holden’s abstract paintings, which seem to glow from the inside.</p>
<p>On our poetic front, Donna Vorreyer takes you to the modern countryside in her poem “Foreclosure Pastoral.” Kirby Snell ponders a pelican carcass in “<i>Pelecanus occidentalis</i>.” And Kat Lewis prods the make-up of our intimate relationships in “We Are on Vacation” and “Our Lady of the Rockies Suddenly Reminds Me of You.”</p>
<p>On our prose front, fiction writer Elizabeth Rodriguez tells a tale you can’t stop reading in her short story “Three.” It’s about immigration, abuse, refuge, and hard choices. We have a special nonfiction feature by Cristina Eisenberg, judge of our 2014 Notes from the Field Nonfiction Contest (open for submissions until November 10). She writes about the science of climate change through the lens of old-growth forests in her essay “Environmental Writing and the Ecology of Hope.” Also in nonfiction, Sarah Robinson investigates the human perception of place during her travels through the American Southwest in “The Space of Desire.” And Mike LeSuer skewers pop culture’s infringement upon nature in “The Implicit Dangers of the Rogue Juice Box.”</p>
<p>We at <i>Flyway</i> deeply believe we’re publishing exciting, innovative, marvelous work, so please join us in celebrating it. Read on!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SEPTEMBER 2014: NEW CONTENT!</p>
<p>Whether you’re kicking off a new academic year, wriggling under the weight of the dog days, or enthusiastically imbibing the heat of summer before it turns into fall, you want to make some room in your schedule for <i>Flyway’s</i> September, 2014, publication cycle.</p>
<p>To put your mind in an artistic mood, you may want to start by investigating our new visuals: evocative macro-photographs by Carolyn Guinzio.</p>
<p>Then head to our non-fiction sector — delight yourself with local food, fiddleheads, and fireflies. Allegra Hyde shares her experience preparing a locally-sourced meal on a Bahamian island in “Coming to the Table”; in “Eating Pieces of the Universe,” Pamela Baker remembers her youth in Maine, foraging for fiddleheads with her father, while she copes with her father’s new-found cancer; and Megan Ewald connects a familial disaster with her passion for the natural world and the magic of fireflies in her essay “Finding Luminescence.”</p>
<p>Our two new pieces of fiction this month visit the dark side, and you won’t be able to stop reading them. In Alisha Karabinus’s ”When Henry Sayles Ate a Bullet,” explore the depression and suicide of a police officer who’s downfall is deeply intertwined with the decline of his small Illinois town. And witness a wrenching freeway accident with the disgruntled narrator of Caleb Stone’s story “Tough World for Tigers.”</p>
<p>Last but never least, we’re featuring three new poems this month that are sure to bewitch you. “Surfeit” by Katherine L. Hester and “A Good Death” by Anne Haven McDonnell capture and reconstitute the pulsing season of summer in two extraordinarily unique, visceral ways. On a different track, fast-paced narrative poem “To the Man Who Ordered the Pad Kee Mow,” by Doc Suds, will have you looking at your ethnic food differently for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Enjoy this work, and thank you for reading, everyone!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just last Sunday, we hosted our annual Flyway Benefit Auction to great success. Thank you to everyone who donated something by participating in one of the events we featured Sunday night. For those friends of Flyway who couldn&#8217;t be there in person, thank you for always being there in spirit. We are about to undergo some big changes, so your support mean all the more to us at this time!</p>
<p>To celebrate the post-benefit/ post-election, here are a few creative selections from around the web in this week&#8217;s web rove:</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/mean/arthur-krystal-and-everyones-favorite-genre-fiction-fallacy/">Arthur Krystal and Everyone&#8217;s Favorite Genre Fiction Fallacy</a>&#8220;<em> </em>by Mike Meginnis (from <em>HTML Giant</em>)<br />
Mike bends and blurs genre; such as his recent &#8220;Navigators&#8221; originally published in <em>Hobart</em> and then included in the <em>Best American Short Stories 2013</em>. He also defends and defines genre as way to compel plot, while also still being a good story. Have a read and then weigh in on the conversation in the comments section.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/343316/the-artist-and-the-critic-8-famous-authoreditor-relationships">The Artist and the Critic</a>&#8221; by Emily Temple (from <em>Flavorwire)</em><br />
Last fall I read the tome <em>Max Perkins: Editor of Genius</em> by biographer A. Scott Berg, which includes the Scribner editor&#8217;s trying relationships with a trifecta of the famous authors F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe. This list of eight editing relationships starts with Perkins and Wolfe, but includes seven other pairings. Throughout them all consider how an editor is a super-reader for a writer.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.worldhum.com/features/travel-stories/why-we-travel-20081213/">Why We Travel</a>&#8221; by Pico Iyer (from <em>WorldHum</em>)<br />
This is a manifesto from a transnational who has witnessed the world by participating in it via travel. Iyer shows both directions of leaving and returning: what we take there and what we bring back. Go on an imaginative trip just by reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/oct/24/simon-garfield-top-10-maps">Top 10 Books with Maps</a>&#8221; by Simon Garfield (from <em>the Guardian</em>)<br />
As cliche as it sounds for this to be a starting point on a journey of maps, this list offers just that. These books include maps on the author&#8217;s radar. Of course, there&#8217;s more than just these ten, so why not add to the list your own favorite maps in books?</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/443/please_dont_vote_for_me">Please Don&#8217;t Vote for Me</a>&#8221; by Sparrow (from <em>the Sun</em>)<br />
As the editors note: &#8220;The poet and political provocateur Sparrow has run for U.S. president in every election since 1992. Sometimes he runs as a Republican and other times as a member of a party of his own invention — the Pajama Party, the Ear of Corn Party, the Sudoku for All Party. To his knowledge he has never received any votes, but this seems only to encourage him.&#8221; Find out why Sparrow even runs, what his &#8220;issues&#8221; are, and how he never gets any votes in this tongue-in-cheek piece.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authors like hysteria. It makes for a good conflict. Historical hysteria against (think of any racist term you want to interject) makes for even better writing&#8211;because now we get to think we&#8217;re better than that. And of course, this is not the limits of hysteria. We&#8217;re also afraid (which can so often lead to hysteria) of diseases, disasters, and <em>those who aren&#8217;t like us</em>. This can be racial, species, or demographic specifc&#8211;just to name a few.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading recently&#8211;plenty of your submissions, but also two books for fun. I recently finished <span style="text-decoration:underline;">13 Moons</span> by Charles Frazier (yes, I&#8217;m just getting around to it), which is better than <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cold Mountain</span>&#8211;at least in my opinion. The writing is tighter and the speaker alternates between an unreliable young adult narrator and the older version of that narrator. Of course, the narrator is really always older and telling what he remembers. Does this make him more unreliable? I think so! Anyway, Frazier manages to discuss the Trail of Tears without didacticism and provides all the key features of a best-seller: violence, romance, and hero goes on a journey. I&#8217;m summarizing a <em>lot </em>but I enjoyed the book.</p>
<p>But that was an overdose in history. To compensate, I&#8217;ve moved to (more modern history) <em>Panic in Level 4 </em>by Richard Preston. I should just state here I love infectious diseases. <em>The Hot Zone </em>introduced me to Richard Preston&#8211;a science writer and a creative nonfiction writer&#8211;and I&#8217;ve since read most of his books. Earlier this year, I read <em>The Wild Trees</em>. You should read that too. But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. <em>Panic in Level 4 </em>begins with an introduction to creative nonfiction and how Preston moves through his process of creative nonfiction fact gathering and writing. Each chapter in the book stems from articles he wrote, mostly for <em>The New Yorker </em>and other such magazines. Give it a read. I don&#8217;t love every chapter&#8211;but I feel like I&#8217;m learning&#8230;and that the learning is fun!</p>
