								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Review by Lydia Melby</span></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">“When the hail came, when the river bucked and broke its banks, when the children lay awake in the late hours fevered and coughing—they knew this place belonged to the devil, had always belonged to him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter" title="Little Wolves cover" alt="" src="http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1333581093l/13536606.jpg" width="223" height="303" /></p>
<p>Thomas Maltman’s second novel, <em>Little Wolves</em>, a 2013 Indie Next pick, has been called a literary thriller, a poetic mystery, called gothic and mythic and haunting. It is a book that defies attempts to assign it a genre, category, or explanation. It is a book that bewilders and excites, moves and mystifies.</p>
<p><em>Little Wolves</em> takes it’s title from an old Cheyenne (and other American Indian nations) term for coyotes. While this isn’t a common name for <em>Canis Latrans</em> in most rural Minnesota communities, the setting of this novel, a small town “about 200 miles west of the Twin Cities” called Lone Mountain, occupies a realm of the surreal and fantastic, where American Indian, Anglo-Saxon, and biblical mythologies wage war, and where coyotes play their little part in other “wolves’” lives. While it’s a “pretty enough town at first glance,” with “women sweeping their porches, the men cutting precise patterns on riding lawnmowers,” a town with church luncheons and lock-ins and an annual Longfellow pageant, Lone Mountain is also a place where it’s inhabitants talk frankly of the devil’s threat, where lone billboards command <em>Thou Shalt Not Kill</em> “in stark black and white” and where residents are still counted strangers twenty=five years after their move.</p>
<p><em>Little Wolves</em> opens in the hours after a troubled teenage boy methodically sawed the barrel off his new shotgun, “limped into town” and shot the town sheriff in the face before committing suicide in a cornfield. The story follows the effects this tragedy has on the boy’s father, Grizz, and Clara, an expecting mother who recently moved to Lone Mountain with her pastor husband and taught Seth’s high school English class.</p>
<p>As Grizz tries to understand how he seemingly knew so little about his son, the boy who saved and raised orphaned coyote pups, Clara tries to come to terms with her own family troubles—a barely-remembered mother, who died under mysterious circumstances, an overbearing father who mythologized her mother’s death with adjusted folklore and legends, and a distant husband preoccupied with his work and ambivalent about their coming child. And as both grope for understanding, they find instead more questions and dark hints, signs for those who would see, that Lone Mountain shelters secrets more vicious than their legends.</p>
<p>In its best moments, <em>Little Wolves</em> is remarkable, a starkly hewn northern gothic in the vein of McCarthy or O’Connor’s southern standards of the genre. Maltman’s prose, especially when describing the desolate prairie in drought or in winter or when suggesting the presence of the Other, a hovering sensation of a figure standing behind you in the dark, that ungrounding when you realize no one is who you thought.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter" title="Maltman, author" alt="" src="http://thomasmaltman.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tom-blue-shirt-filter2.jpg" width="378" height="284" /></p>
<p>In Lone Mountain, Maltman brings together several very real threats—a violent outburst, menacing authorities, stone-faced secrets, drought, modernization, even the coming winter. The story takes off with the first two jarring, gripping chapters, and as the tension piles on, the reader’s flush of adrenaline seems a natural and necessary reaction.</p>
<p>Atop this gritty realism are many layers of the supernatural—Clara’s obsession with Anglo-Saxon mythology, and her belief that both the legend of Beowulf and of her missing mother hold the key to some great mystery, collides with her husband’s (and the community’s) fear of Satan and God’s wrath and Grizz’s lifelong fixation on the Hiawatha lore. Admittedly, these elements are heavy doses taken all together, but Maltman uses these devices to sketch what his expert tone has already implied—a pervading darkness hovering over the town, seeping in at the edges of everyone’s vision but impossible to face head on.</p>
<p>With <em>Little Wolves</em>, Maltman weaves a beautiful, bewildering cloth. His plot, which begins anchored in the gritty realism he does so well, becomes slightly unmoored by its own fantasy as the many loosely knotted narrative threads twist into something vague and inscrutable. However, the characters, though often baffling in interaction and motivation, are sympathetic and genuine, while the suspense and eerie atmosphere certainly earns <em>Little Wolves</em> its loose ends and indulgences.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the considerable strength of <em>Little Wolves</em> lays in how deftly the author evokes his lovely, unsettling landscape—dropping readers into a scene, a fear, a town, a way of life. Even as the plot grows chaotic, Maltman’s prose does not falter—many passages caught my breath and brought me back to reread and savor, like the passage below, as Grizz broods over a rifle, “a cold deadweight… the farm boys in this stretch of country grew up with.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left">“They became teenagers who shot at street signs from moving cars or shot loads of buckshot straight up in the sky and then scurried for cover before the deadly lead rained down. They grew up and the guns grew with them. A .410 could take down a coon or even a small deer at close range; a 20 gauge could pluck a fleeing pheasant or goose from the blue. Shot or slug, steel or lead, they could cite velocities and tell stories of the improbably kill or the one that got away. They ate what they killed, mostly, but sometimes they killed out of boredom… kills they later regretted but could not undo.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This moment, eerily relevant today, is just one of many that echo in the reader’s skull. And that, perhaps, is the mark of a fine novel—not the number of loose threads or missing answers, but rather something that strikes deep enough that we care enough to circle these stranded questions hours, days, even weeks after we have closed the book.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left" align="center"><em>by Stefanie Brook Trout</em></p>
<p>Lauren Groff’s newly published second novel,<em> Arcadia</em>, opens in the 1960’s on a hippie commune in upstate New York, but it doesn’t stay there.  The book spans approximately fifty years of the life of Ridley Sorrel Stone, the “oldest soul in Arcadia” whose birth on the caravan is a legend by the time he is five years old.  Ridley goes by Bit because of his three-pound birth weight—“the littlest bit of a hippie ever made”—and small size he retains through adulthood, and the story is told in little bits, brief episodes glimpsed through Bit’s perspective.  Throughout the book, Bit loves and loses, but rarely are those moments distinct from one another.  <em>Arcadia</em> is a story about both the ugly side of wonderful and the beautiful side of terrible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter" title="Arcadia book cover" alt="" src="http://img2-1.timeinc.net/ew/i/2012/03/07/arcadia-2_320.jpg" width="256" height="389" /><br />
Following a one-page prologue in which the close third-person protagonist narrates from in utero, the rest of <em>Arcadia</em> is broken up into four parts, each of which consist of several episodes ranging in length from one paragraph to several pages separated by white space.  The first chapter, “City of the Sun,” is set on the commune where Bit is only five years old but more aware of his surroundings than the adults, who are blinded by love, ego, survival, and/or drugs.  Chapter two, “Heliopolis,” flashes forward to fourteen-year-old Bit, falling in love and sharing a swollen commune with nine hundred Arcadians.  Eventually tragedy pulls the community apart.  As crises causes Arcadia’s numbers to spiral downward, Bit’s parents debate the relative merits of staying or leaving.  Chapter three, “Isles of the Blest,” flashes forward decades into the future and Bit’s adulthood in New York City, where he has retained the magic of his youth through photography.  The final chapter, “Garden of Earthly Delights,” flashes still forward.  A different tragedy brings Bit back to Arcadia, which “without people […] is only land,” but through the event’s ugliness, Bit is able to see that “all is well in the world.”</p>
<p>I was inherently interested in reading a book about a commune, where dozens of hippies do yoga together, midwives strip down to deliver babies in the buff, and everyone enjoys vegan meals together, but the opening line was almost too much for me:  “The women in the river, singing.”  Bit insists on remembering this event, though he wasn’t born for another three weeks.  The effect of the prologue, however, is to force the question of Bit’s reliability as a narrator.  Either he is impossibly aware or the facts with which he presents the reader do not reflect reality.  The story is narrated realistically, but the women in Bit’s life suggest that what he remembers to be true could be unconscious workings of his imagination.  The book consistently omits quotation marks, rendering the dialogue ambiguous.  When do the spoken words stop and Bit’s thoughts on them begin?</p>
<p>The prologue also introduces two motifs critical to understanding Bit’s perspective.  “He has always loved the voices of women,” and in a sense this book is more about Bit’s women than Bit himself.  Bit also prefers to be incubated from the world, whether by his mother’s womb, by a commune that sets itself apart, or by the darkrooms that he retreats to in adulthood.  The outside world frightens him.  It is “too much,” “too full of terror and beauty.”</p>
<p>As Bit matures and as the setting of <em>Arcadia</em> moves in time and space, the book’s language evolves.  What the cynical adult Bit calls the “doubleplusgood duckspeak” from his youth, when starvation is euphemized as a form of yoga, becomes more honest as technology and disease distinguish Bit’s new world and embitter his worldview.  The level of characterization also changes throughout the book.  In the first chapter, Bit introduces approximately fifty characters, each of whom plays a distinct role in his life.  By the second chapter, “herds of Trippies,” who should be accompanied by their ”Minders,” and crowds of “Newbies,” “freeloaders,” and “Runaways” swarm anonymously around Bit, whose love for Arcadia derived from a love of community.  After Arcadia peaks and starts to collapse upon itself, the cast of characters to whom Bit pays mind dwindles.  “Sometimes Bit imagines that he, alone, bears witness to the world,” but with age he sees less and less until he realizes that he too has “become a person who stopped <em>noticing</em>.”</p>
<p>I initially did not appreciate the chapter breaks and their jarring jumps through time.  At the beginning of each chapter, I felt like I was reading a new book featuring the same narrator.  In fact, <em>Arcadia</em> could have been broken up into four books comprising a mini-series.  Each chapter has a new setting in time and place, new characters, and new conflicts.  Bit fills in the skipped time with flashbacks, but these are only brief snapshots that must be developed individually before they can be assembled as a whole.  I especially would have preferred a chapter in between the second and third since that temporal leap is the greatest, but overall I came to appreciate Groff’s structural strategy and the sense of mystery it created.</p>
<p>Bit learned to read by studying a book of Grimms’ fairy tales, a book that he found and hid as contraband since personal property was forbidden at Arcadia.  He tried to cast the people around him as characters in those magical stories where good always triumphed over evil and everyone lives happily every after.  <em>Arcadia</em> is a story about good and evil, but unlike fairy tales, the two sides do not diametrically oppose each other but are taken together.  That which made the commune wonderful also led to its downfall.  That which provoked Bit to fall in love also insured that his heart would be broken.  And the tragedies that destroyed Arcadia and individuals who beheld it also made them stronger.  In composing <em>Arcadia</em>, Groff thought of everything.  She played with structure, characterization, setting, and language to evoke themes in a seamless way that appears effortless, though as a writer I know better.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Book Review: <em>Send Me Work</em> by Katherine Karlin<br />
by: Tegan Swanson</p>
<p>Katherine Karlin has worked in oil refineries, shipyards, print shops, and universities; and she sends the narrators of <em>Send Me Work</em>—almost exclusively female—into similar spaces. These women deal with an interplay of both contemporary social justice issues and ordinary, pedestrian conflicts, which Karlin navigates successfully when she refuses to rely on either for the stereotypical dramas they usually illicit.</p>
<p>In “Muscle Memory” the grief of a Hurricane Katrina widow and her daughter manifests not in funeral scenes, but in the cans of non-perishable food items the family has been stockpiling in a back closet. From the title story, which derives its name from the misheard lyrics of a Bruce Springsteen song, a woman spends the afternoon with a friend dying during the 1980s AIDS epidemic.  Rather than discuss his homophobic father or the Kaposi’s sarcomas consuming his body, the two friends discuss fashion and make jokes about the song lyrics.  Working on a fair-trade coffee plantation and surrounded by political instability in Nicaragua, an American in “Into the Blue Again” succumbs not to water-borne disease or violent revolutionaries, but a man who needs a personal trainer. These bends in detail or logic prevent both microcosm and macrocosm in Karlin’s literary worlds from becoming mundane, and they keep her off of a soapbox.</p>
<div id="attachment_771" style="width: 305px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.k-state.edu/english/people/alph/karlin.html" target="_blank"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-771" class=" wp-image-771  " title="K. Karlin" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/karlin.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="286" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-771" class="wp-caption-text">Author Katherine Karlin</p></div>
<p>Like the twists in subject matter, Karlin uses non-traditional structure to ensure that her stories reveal extraordinary facets of the everyday. The stories rarely take place in a closed-circuit loop, coming in and out of the lives of her characters sometime after the beginning, and usually far before the end. She echoes this episodic quality in the structure of “Seven Reasons,” a numbered, sectioned story which circles around a suicidal hobo and his approaching train. Issues like misogyny and poverty have no easy resolutions, and Karlin does not pretend otherwise, leaving her narrators at refineries, in rail yards, or wandering through Orthodox neighborhoods mid-struggle. Although this technique occasionally left me feeling pulled out of the narrative, having turned the page only to find that the story had ended already, in stories where the final moments still provide some closure for the arc of the narrative itself, these nebulous leaps out of scene succeed.</p>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/62-9780810152205-0" target="_blank"><img class=" " title="Cover" src="http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/Portals/0/images%5Ccovers%5C9780810152205.gif" alt="" width="300" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Send Me Work by Katherine Karlin, TriQuarterly Books (2011)</p></div>
<p>As a writer in a culture hell-bent on instant gratification, I feel a sauce-pot-on-the-low-burner, creeping-tension-in-my-chest-cavity, ear-drums-on-the-airplane kind of pressure whenever I sit down to start a new story. I feel its me versus the 24-hour information cycle, both of us barreling headlong toward an ever-shifting line drawn in digital sand between old news, and news worth knowing.  I want to bring stories to a meaningful life, one where characters act as mirrors of their surroundings, existing in an honest, often painfully, inevitable way; where specificities of place build an uncommon world contained not within 140 characters but within a few pages; where the ills of 21<sup>st</sup> century Earth have moved themselves in like clinging, unwanted house guests, all of them quietly disrupting the peace of everything around, no-holds-barred.  Each story is a struggle, my out-of-breath creative mind searching constantly for a viable, if not slightly wobbling, bridge to follow forward. I spend my time trying—and often failing—to leap from the just-finished past toward our genuine, ever-vanishing present, one paragraph at a time.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am masochistic as a reader, but I love to be made wildly, incomprehensibly jealous by writers whose work embodies these aspirational qualities, and in Katherine Karlin’s collection <em>Send Me Work</em>, I found many moments to be wildly, incomprehensibly jealous. These quiet, modest stories reveal strength in their troubled narrators without turning them into martyrs or damsels-in-distress.<em> </em>Both the true and scrambled lyrics of Springsteen’s “song about driving all night” lend their meaning as an adage appropriate for the collection. These women of Karlin’s stories are both searching for signs of resolution in struggle <em>and </em>moving steadily forward through the obstacles of lives lived always in conflict.</p>
