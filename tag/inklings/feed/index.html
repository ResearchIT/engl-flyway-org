								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I know many of you are eagerly awaiting the latest issue of <em>Flyway</em>. As you know, we got it to the printer a bit later than we might have liked&#8211;but it&#8217;s there now and we hope to have it back in time for AWP (meaning, we hope to have it back in early April). The printer says there will be about a 3-week turn around&#8211;but I know from experience that this is the average. This issue contains winners from two contests: Notes from the Field (creative prose about the environment) and Home Voices (open only to members of the Iowa State creative writing graduate program). We also feature two artists (artists&#8217; work is solicited; we do not accept unsolicited artwork).</p>
<p>On another note, we need more of you to inkle! That&#8217;s what we call it (thanks to the suggestion of a long-time contributor) when you respond to one of our Monthly Inklings. The month is already (almost) halfway over! Remember, the winning Inklings will be feature here!</p>
