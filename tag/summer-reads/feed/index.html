								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A review by Geetha Iyer</em></p>
<p>Karl Taro Greenfeld’s collection of stories, <em>NowTrends</em>, documents the escape routes of twelve diverse protagonists, many of whom find themselves lucklessly deposited back where they started. This is not to suggest that the stories go nowhere; indeed, each tale is marked by an almost breathless exploration of place. The characters globetrot from the United States to Japan, China to France, Amsterdam, Nepal, Indonesia, sometimes within the space of a single story. The strongest stories in the collection even leap back in time, exploring the destruction or establishment of identity in Japan during the Second World War. However, the underlying tension within each story is the hanging doubt, often understated, that life is an ellipse, not an arc; the characters do not overcome adversity but rather revisit it, often.</p>
<p>This theme is explored in tragicomic detail in “Mistakes were Made, Errors Happened.” The young, unnamed protagonist flies from California to Tokyo in search of his identity. He goes broke. In his hunt for cash he follows the suggestions of: a “diabolically brilliant” partner in crime who gets him fired; a “sexy koala bear” callgirl who puts a hit on him; and a “kind of fat” English teacher and sometimes-model who breaks up with him. He spirals in ever-tightening circles around the drain hole of failure. He reflects upon his life, finds himself stuck, somewhere here: “____________________I__________________.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in “The Gymnast,” Greenfeld takes the ellipse to novelistic heights, following the rise and fall of Xiao, a young Chinese Olympic hopeful. Her coaches orchestrate physical and technical perfection, her peers covet it, and her mother—in fervent hope of Olympic glory—urges her daughter to “listen to [her] coaches” as they artificially suspend her adolescence to boost her performance. Xiao is resourceful, but the challenges she faces are monumental; her eventual escape from the trap of ambition comes at a wrenching cost.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="NowTrends cover" src="http://contentcafe2.btol.com/ContentCafe/Jacket.aspx?&amp;userID=NYPL49807&amp;password=CC68707&amp;Value=9780982530153&amp;content=M&amp;Return=1&amp;Type=M" alt="" width="192" height="270" /><a href="http://www.karltarogreenfeld.com/karltarogreenfeld/home.html">     <img class="alignnone" title="Karl Taro Greenfeld" src="http://www.asiahealthcareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/karl-taro-greenfeld.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>In other stories, the protagonists are naïve or apathetic about adulthood. In “Amsterdam,” the narrator, Karl—who shares the same first name and occupation as the author—is listless even after selling his first book, and passes time high on drugs and wondering how long his money will last. In “Copper Top,” an older Karl—who again may or may not be Greenfeld himself—is haunted by his anxieties, which include hypochondria, paranoia, and lack of self-confidence. In these auto-fictional stories, Greenfeld uses humor to highlight the tragedy of a certain kind of contemporary existence—that a comfortable life may feel impoverished if one’s self-worth is as vaporous as mist.</p>
<p><em>NowTrends</em> traces unrequited love and failed ambition, and in the sharpest stories, Greenfeld pairs his protagonists with richly developed foils to heighten the contrast between loss and gain. In “Silver,” the American boss of a company in Hong Kong gradually roots for the happiness of the eponymous leader of the company’s football team. In “Client” the reader and narrator share their contempt for the boorish Japanese mountaineer who is the first blind man to climb Mount Everest. And in the title story, “NowTrends,” a mild-mannered Chinese celebrity journalist crosses paths with a documentary film-making friend from university, now imprisoned by the government.</p>
<p>The protagonists in <em>NowTrends</em> seem to orbit tragedy, and their lives are ironic, bittersweet. “Mickey Mouse,” the second-to-last story in the collection, is therefore a stand-out. Ohta is a struggling artist commissioned to boost morale by designing a replacement for Mickey Mouse, an “enemy” of the Japanese Empire during wartime. To reveal more would rob the story of a richly satisfying moment, well-earned after Greenfeld’s meticulous documentation of misadventures in the other stories.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of journeys, the ones where you escape your origins and the ones where you return to where you started. Karl Taro Greenfeld’s <em>NowTrends</em> tantalizes with one kind of journey, then subverts conventional expectations of what will eventually happen. His protagonists are caught in culture clashes, coming-of-age uncertainties, and identity crises; they give us something to think about as we contemplate our own escapes from the formidable and the mundane.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard the buzz about <a href="www.patricksomerville.com">Patrick Somerville</a>&#8216;s latest novel, <em>This Bright River</em>, but if you&#8217;re looking for something more on the &#8220;miniature&#8221; side this late into the summer reading season, first check out Somerville&#8217;s story collection, <em>The Universe in Miniature in Miniature </em>(Featherproof, 2010). Looking at the book&#8217;s spread (which boasts the ability to transform into a homemade mobile), you will wonder if the stories inside live up to the design&#8217;s promise of whimsy, scientific play and bizarre, slightly unhinged voice. And you will close the book satisfied. Each story combats the WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? of human life with even more insistent proclamation of what it means to be human in a time when no one can be too sure of the answers. The relief here is that Somerville&#8217;s characters never take themselves too seriously &#8212; or else they take themselves so seriously that the gravity of their voices give way into a truer kind of meaning. Throughout each piece, the world teeters on some unfathomable edge of an even more unfathomable universe, but the narrative ultimately survives.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780982580813-0"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.featherproof.com/Mambo/images/OUTSIDElayoutMOCK2.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a collection of voice-propelled short stories &#8212; from several pieces of flash fiction to the collection&#8217;s concluding novella &#8212; then Patrick Somerville&#8217;s <em>The Universe in Miniature in Miniature</em> is the summer read for you. Order the book (from Powell&#8217;s or another indie bookstore), read feverishly, and finish the experience with a cockamanie attempt at constructing the book&#8217;s solar system mobile. After all, why are books still around anyway, if not to cut along the dotted lines and add popsicle sticks, then string?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">“Summer is for reading books about the end of the world”<br />
— A friend, on summer reads</p>
<p>Most of what I’ve been reading this summer could be called speculative fiction, or near-future, or post-apocalyptic, or just good ol’ sci-fi. Books about the end of the world fascinate me, and I’ve read some rewardingly sinister predictions, some hopeful projections about rebuilding, and some kooky excuses to dismiss social progress in the name of returning humans to their ‘natural’ state. Among the crumbling governments and strange technologies I’ve been exploring, Paolo Bacigalupi’s whirlwind novel, <em>The Windup Girl</em>, which won the 2010 Hugo and Nebula awards and many other honors, stands apart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/0-9781597801577-0"><img class="aligncenter" title="Wind-up Girl cover" src="http://chamberfour.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/the-windup-girl-shopped.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>The narrative offers Bacigalupi’s startling vision of a world where oil has run out, ending the days of the Old Expansion; where companies like SoyPro, U-Tex, and AgriGen filled the world’s fields with genehacked crops so non-diverse they were wiped out by a couple of engineered plagues, where technology has lead to chameleonic cat infestations and 15-ton elephants are used as work animals, and where “windups”—New People engineered to be strong, beautiful, and instinctually subservient—are used to fulfill human whims.</p>
<p>But Bacigalupi doesn’t spend his time marveling over these strange events and making sure the reader knows precisely how they came about, since these events are history in this world; instead he places his narrative in the days of the “New Expansion,” when nations have rebuilt to some degree, when clipper ships and high-tech dirigibles have become commonplace again, when all technology—from crank-fans to treadle-computers—is powered by human energy, and when civil wars and political coup d’états are again concerns as big as the food supply. He evokes a world that has, at least somewhat, adapted to its own end, and is fighting to survive another.</p>
<p>While this level of complex world-building seems overwhelming at first, Bacigalupi achieves a sense of causality and wholeness in his new world. The reader is not bogged down with superfluous details and explanations of “what went wrong” and “how stuff works now,&#8221; but is rather immersed in a completely fresh era and place which may take some getting used to, but is tangible and constant. By containing his narrative in Bangkok, Thailand, Bacigalupi shows how the worldwide events have radically affected this microcosm, allowing him to reasonably hint at the struggles the rest of the world is facing without writing a 1200 page novel.</p>
<p>He also gives a multi-faceted view of the Bangkok microcosm, as the narrative rotates among four main characters—Emiko, the mysterious ‘windup’ of the title; Anderson Lake, a ‘calorie man’ spy sent by the megalithic AgriGen to seek out Thailand’s seedbank in hope of “generipping” its riches; Tan Hock Seng, a former shipping king and “yellow card” (Chinese refugee), who schemes to regain his former wealth and status; and Captain Jaidee Rojjanasukchai of the Thai Environment Ministry, called “The Tiger of Bangkok” for his fierce dedication to the environmental health of the city he loves. These four are joined by an array of supporting characters just as diverse (but not to worry, Bacigalupi’s taken care to give them memorable names, e.g. “Dog Fucker”).</p>
<p>But the true protagonist of the story is Bacigalupi’s city of Bangkok, or Krung Thep, depending on the narrator’s nationality. He has clearly done his research on the challenges facing present-day Thailand, and offers a vision of a struggling nation’s capital fighting rising sea levels and rampant disease mutations. While each of the human characters fight for their own interests and reveal their own dark sides, it’s this hopeful, but broken city in a strange and broken world that the reader comes to care for most in the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://windupstories.com"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://windupstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/paolobacigalupi300dpi.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="253" /></a></p>
<p>While I’m partial to as many characters as one can stuff into a story, some readers might find the story crowded; likewise, Bacigalupi’s constantly shifting narrative, and one particularly daring perspective shift, might contradict expected storytelling ‘rules’. However, these characters—each of different ethnicity and social standing, each with their own complex loyalties and desires—are one of the elements that set this story apart from other speculative fiction or futuristic novels.</p>
<p><em>The Windup Girl</em> isn’t strictly a cautionary tale (though one might wish certain FDA officials would read it), and it’s not a trip through one writer’s imaginative paranoia, either. The novel is Bacigalupi’s vision of our world in a possible future—a frightening, exciting, and even sometimes hopeful vision of what happens when resources are abused, communities taken for granted, and everyone—deserving or not—gets what is coming.</p>

<p>In the December 21<sup>st</sup>, 2009 issue of <em>TIME </em>magazine, I read an inch-wide article titled “America’s Most Wanted Teenage Bandit” about Colton Harris-Moore’s recent Cessna theft, crash, and barefoot escape from the wreckage. A photo accompanied the article: a pudgy-faced, dirty blonde kid stared at the camera that he held for a self-portrait. He wore a black polo with a white Mercedes-Benz logo patched above his heart.</p>
<p>Colton Harris-Moore (a.k.a. The Barefoot Bandit) captivated me with his nonchalance thievery and autodidactic pilot skills. He stole from citizens of the small vacationer community of Camano Island off the coast of Pungent Sound in the state of Washington. He learned how to fly from playing flight simulators on his computer and reading a flying manual he had ordered online.</p>
<p>Recently, I read Bob Friel’s thorough, but unsympathetic, “The Ballad of Colton Harris-Moore” in <em>Outside </em>magazine’s December 2009 issue. Apparently, Friel first broke the story about Colton in that article and has since spent the last several years tracking and investigating him for a book titled after his alias. This summer I’m looking forward to reading about the rascal thief <em>The Barefoot Bandit</em>: <em>The True Tale of Colton Harris-Moore, New American Outlaw </em>(Hyperion, March 2012).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though it’s almost ten years old, I want to recommend <em>Buffalo Dance </em>by Frank X Walker, Kentucky poet and founding member of the <a href="http://www.affrilachianpoets.com/">Affrilachian Poets</a>. I recently plucked this book back off the shelf because I’ve found myself telling everyone about it. In this collection, Walker assumes the voice of York, slave of William Clark, to retell the story of the famous Lewis &amp; Clark expedition. Through York, Walker explores the “discovering” of the western territory, the interactions with native tribes, and the landscape he fears the men he aids will ruin. For anyone interested in thematic collections, historical poetry, or just plain beautiful language, I highly recommend Walker’s work.</p>
