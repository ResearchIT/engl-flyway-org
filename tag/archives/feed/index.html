<p>by Erin Schmiel</p>
<p>I love how easily Todd Davis expresses themes of spirituality in his quiet nature poems. He says, in &#8220;Learning to Read,”: “I understand that learning to read,/like so much of life, is about faith and doubt —/the possibility of one, the heaviness of the other.&#8221; In just three narrative stanzas we see the progression from the oblivion of the 5 year old narrator: &#8220;my joy when you told me/I was driving, too young to realize you held /the wheel&#8221;, to the responsibility of road markers: &#8220;signs /sprouted like goldenrod and Queen Anne&#8217;s lace, and you/demanded I read them, pretending not to know/what to do if I didn&#8217;t.&#8221; The final stanza carries the reader forward from this scene and out into the world knowing that what has been said is as true for them as it was for the father and son.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Some Heaven&#8221; the narrator is a father watching his child pray for &#8220;some heaven/that has no fences,&#8221; after they find a rabbit &#8220;caught between the slats of the fence,” that he has had to kill. I feel he is asking for forgiveness, too, when he believes his child&#8217;s &#8220;prayer is right/ What more should heaven be? /A place made/ of wild carrot and dill…a warm October/day that never ends.&#8221;</p>
<p>These words cut me to the quick with their urgent, yet natural spirituality. I had to pause and say —yes— this is the way of it not only for the lives in the poems, for me the reader as well.</p>
<p>Both poems are republished below with permission from the author. <span id="more-4406"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Learning to Read&#8221; by Todd Davis</p>
<p>Before seatbelt laws and airbags began to pull</p>
<p>families apart, you let me ride up front, seated</p>
<p>between your legs. My joy when you told me</p>
<p>I was steering, too young to realize you held</p>
<p>the wheel below, was incommensurate with the act.</p>
<p>But what more does a five year old wish for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the back roads of Michigan, signs sprouted</p>
<p>like goldenrod and Queens Anne&#8217;s lace, and you</p>
<p>demanded I read them, pretending not to know</p>
<p>what to do if I didn&#8217;t. The weight of your words</p>
<p>was nothing like the impress of the declarations</p>
<p>written in bold black on yellow, or the infinite space</p>
<p>white made when placed on a metal so red</p>
<p>children at slumber parties would tell stories</p>
<p>of the dead whose blood colored it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, the weight I carried came from the letters</p>
<p>whose meaning I worked hard to explicate, trying</p>
<p>to understand how they offered either absolution</p>
<p>or extinction—our very future depending upon</p>
<p>how I sounded out S-T-O-P. Knowing now</p>
<p>you would have stopped whether I could read</p>
<p>the sign or not, I understand that learning to read,</p>
<p>like so much of life, is about faith and doubt—</p>
<p>the possibility of one, the heaviness of the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some Heaven&#8221; by Todd Davis</p>
<p>The rabbit&#8217;s head is caught</p>
<p>between the slats of the fence,</p>
<p>and in its struggle it has turned</p>
<p>so now the hind legs nearly touch</p>
<p>the nose—neck broken, lungs failing.</p>
<p>My boys ask me to do something</p>
<p>but see no mercy in my plan</p>
<p>to make sure the animal is dead.</p>
<p>At four and seven, they are so far</p>
<p>away from their own deaths</p>
<p>that they cannot imagine</p>
<p>the blessing a shovel might hold,</p>
<p>nor the lesson suffering offers</p>
<p>to those who have not suffered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At bedtime, my youngest prays</p>
<p>the rabbit is in some heaven</p>
<p>where there are no fences, where</p>
<p>in death there is more than enough</p>
<p>to eat. He begins to cry, and we rock</p>
<p>until sleep&#8217;s embrace takes him</p>
<p>from me. Sitting on his bed, I know</p>
<p>his prayer is right. What more</p>
<p>should heaven be? A place made</p>
<p>of wild carrot and dill, sunflower</p>
<p>and phlox, fields the stretch on</p>
<p>for miles, every coyote full, every</p>
<p>hawk passing over, a warm October</p>
<p>day that need never end.</p>

<p>Otherness: Flyway’s Asian American Special Issue</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em> reveals the “other” in identity, cross-cultural mishaps, food, and sense of place with this special Asian American issue. From the black and white photograph of Japanese-Americans departing for WWII internment camps, on the cover, to a white woman’s confusion in her Thai boyfriend’s family in “The Whitest Woman in America,” the writings in this collection reach beyond what it means to be Asian-American. Poems and stories in this issue reveal the collectivity of human experiences, exploring what it means to be human. The following are standout pieces of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction found in this issue:</p>
<p><span id="more-4396"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>“Minidoka, Idaho, Winter 1944,” a poem by former Iowa State University professor Neil Nakadate, recalls the double-standard of being “other,” as Japanese-Americans fought for the U.S. during WWII while their families were interned at relocation camps. The final two lines capture the heart of the poem: “Gold stars shine in the desert night,/ and dust settles on the windowpanes.” Another poem, “Backflips” by Charles Valle, portrays the duality and isolation of the speaker’s experience in tightly constructed tercets: “I learned from the laughter/ Simulated in sitcoms/ Just where to touch/ People and make them forget/ Just how foreign/ My first words were.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity in this issue is taken seriously by most writers, such as Nakadate and Valle. However, some writers approach the subject with sardonic wit. In “How the Lee Family Has Fun on a Friday Night,” San Franciscan poet Priscilla Lee juxtaposes stereotypes of Chinese families with Richard Simmons exercise tapes: “<em>Is this what Chinese people</em> / <em>do for a good time on a Friday night?</em> George asks, wondering what the hell/ happened to mahjong and opium dens.” Sarah Littlecrow-Russel’s poem “My Ancestor’s Supernatural Dating Service Fails” provides a portrait of multicultural confusion and role of women in relationships. The prose piece “Deflowering the Sampaguita” by M. Evelina Galang, further explores the confusion of love in the context of a God-fearing culture: “Here is how we come to learn of Jesus, Our Savior. Here is what they tell us. First Holy Communion. Like the first time you are with the man you love — but they don’t say that part.”</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Both of the previously described pieces and many others also present individuals in conflict with their families and family values.“The Whitest Woman in America” by Katherine Riegal is another example of family and cross-cultural misunderstanding, as the protagonist tries to fit in with her boyfriend Ira’s Thai mother and sisters. Many of the scenes center around the protagonist’s lack of knowledge about the Thai language, leaving her outside of the family dynamic: “Chin tastes a strawberry and says ‘Sweet!’ her highest praise for fruit. ‘Taste like,’ she pauses, ‘I don’t know the English word.’ Ira says ‘Monkut?’ ‘Yes, yes,’ she says, but when I ask Ira what monkut is, he says it doesn’t taste anything like strawberries.”</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Place and natural imagery also dominates the issue, from reflecting on places where family came from to the places the speakers of these writings live, work and love. In the lyrical poem “Mid-Autumn Moon” by Jeffery Thomas Leong, where the speaker’s acute observations and rhythmic pacing mimics ancient Chinese and Japanese poets in his reflection on his future marriage: “Just moonlight laying itself down upon/ the newly-opened earth, absorbing crimson in layered soil, finally grounded.”</li>
</ul>
