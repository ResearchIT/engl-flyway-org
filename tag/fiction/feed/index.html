								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chilly fall weather and the growing darkness have you huddling inside? Open up the latest edition of <i>Flyway</i> and let the electricity of our new content exhilarate you from head to toe.</p>
<p>Whet your artistic palate with our fresh visual art. Kristi Beisecker creates scintillating photograms by exposing organic objects to electricity and capturing the interaction on photosensitive paper. And take your time with Laurence Holden’s abstract paintings, which seem to glow from the inside.</p>
<p>On our poetic front, Donna Vorreyer takes you to the modern countryside in her poem “Foreclosure Pastoral.” Kirby Snell ponders a pelican carcass in “<i>Pelecanus occidentalis</i>.” And Kat Lewis prods the make-up of our intimate relationships in “We Are on Vacation” and “Our Lady of the Rockies Suddenly Reminds Me of You.”</p>
<p>On our prose front, fiction writer Elizabeth Rodriguez tells a tale you can’t stop reading in her short story “Three.” It’s about immigration, abuse, refuge, and hard choices. We have a special nonfiction feature by Cristina Eisenberg, judge of our 2014 Notes from the Field Nonfiction Contest (open for submissions until November 10). She writes about the science of climate change through the lens of old-growth forests in her essay “Environmental Writing and the Ecology of Hope.” Also in nonfiction, Sarah Robinson investigates the human perception of place during her travels through the American Southwest in “The Space of Desire.” And Mike LeSuer skewers pop culture’s infringement upon nature in “The Implicit Dangers of the Rogue Juice Box.”</p>
<p>We at <i>Flyway</i> deeply believe we’re publishing exciting, innovative, marvelous work, so please join us in celebrating it. Read on!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SEPTEMBER 2014: NEW CONTENT!</p>
<p>Whether you’re kicking off a new academic year, wriggling under the weight of the dog days, or enthusiastically imbibing the heat of summer before it turns into fall, you want to make some room in your schedule for <i>Flyway’s</i> September, 2014, publication cycle.</p>
<p>To put your mind in an artistic mood, you may want to start by investigating our new visuals: evocative macro-photographs by Carolyn Guinzio.</p>
<p>Then head to our non-fiction sector — delight yourself with local food, fiddleheads, and fireflies. Allegra Hyde shares her experience preparing a locally-sourced meal on a Bahamian island in “Coming to the Table”; in “Eating Pieces of the Universe,” Pamela Baker remembers her youth in Maine, foraging for fiddleheads with her father, while she copes with her father’s new-found cancer; and Megan Ewald connects a familial disaster with her passion for the natural world and the magic of fireflies in her essay “Finding Luminescence.”</p>
<p>Our two new pieces of fiction this month visit the dark side, and you won’t be able to stop reading them. In Alisha Karabinus’s ”When Henry Sayles Ate a Bullet,” explore the depression and suicide of a police officer who’s downfall is deeply intertwined with the decline of his small Illinois town. And witness a wrenching freeway accident with the disgruntled narrator of Caleb Stone’s story “Tough World for Tigers.”</p>
<p>Last but never least, we’re featuring three new poems this month that are sure to bewitch you. “Surfeit” by Katherine L. Hester and “A Good Death” by Anne Haven McDonnell capture and reconstitute the pulsing season of summer in two extraordinarily unique, visceral ways. On a different track, fast-paced narrative poem “To the Man Who Ordered the Pad Kee Mow,” by Doc Suds, will have you looking at your ethnic food differently for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Enjoy this work, and thank you for reading, everyone!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mike Alberti is the winner of our 2014 Sweet Corn Short Fiction Contest. Our Fiction Editor Chloe Clark recently caught up with him for an email interview.</p>
<p>1.) What inspired the writing of &#8220;The Gully?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a combination of things, but I think it began with the imagery of the setting. Last year, I drove from Albuquerque, where I’m from, to Minneapolis, where I live. On the way I drove across Eastern Colorado and Nebraska and Iowa, and that was a landscape that I had never really seen before. Just the glimpse of the Great Plains that I was able to see from the window of a car was mesmerizing to me, but I realized that I didn’t have the language to think about it. I didn’t really know what a gully was, or a bluff or a headland. I couldn’t name what I was seeing, and that became the catalyst for the story: a character who has lost touch with the landscape he grew up with.</p>
<p>I also wanted to explore the connections between language, landscape, and violence. I think we sometimes tend to talk about the natural world like we own it, or control it, and that’s very dangerous. It’s also dangerous to deny our agency ⎯ I’m thinking about climate change ⎯ but to think of and talk about ourselves as masters of the earth seems both delusional and imperious: when it doesn’t rain there’s not much you can do about it. That kind of domineering attitude can be used to justify all kinds of things, and I think probably leads to alienation, not only from the natural world, but from each other, as well.</p>
<p>I actually had been writing my way around this story for a while, had done a good deal of research, and I had a lot of the material for it already ⎯ the setting, the characters ⎯ but it wasn’t coming together. Then one day, for some reason, the dog worked his way in there and after that he kind of became the still point at the center, with the rest of the story revolving around this one incident.</p>
<p>2.) This may go along with the first question, but did you grow up in a community similar to the one you depict?</p>
<p>No, I grew up in Albuquerque, though some of the places where I’ve lived have affinities with the community in the story. I’ve always been fascinated with very insular fictional settings, small contained worlds, so may of my stories seem to take place in small towns. I did do some research though, on the geography and the history of the region, especially the troubled recent economic and agricultural history, because I wanted the story to ring true to people who actually live there. But, in the end, it’s mostly imaginary.</p>
<p>3.) What is your writing process like?</p>
<p>I wish I had a good answer to this question, but I’m still figuring it out myself! It seems to change with every story. I try (and often fail) to write for a while every morning. Usually I have to start a story over several times, making slightly more progress each time, until I find a voice that can carry me all the way to the end. When I finish a first draft I like to put it away and work on other things for a while ⎯ at least a month but often more ⎯ so that I can come back to it with fresh eyes. Sometimes I abandon a story at that point, but if it still resonates when I pick it up again, then I like to do a kind of “self-workshop” where I write myself a letter about the story, as honestly as I can. After I address those criticisms in revision (which can take a long time), then it’s time to show it to people. It’s a pretty slow process.</p>
<p>4.) How long have you been writing and what got you started in writing?</p>
<p>I’ve been writing since high school, and writing “seriously” since college, though there have been some gaps. I think I must have started writing in an English class in high school, but I actually don’t remember the moment I thought, “I’m going to try this now.” I know that I have had a number of incredibly supportive teachers, without whom writing might not have morphed from hobby to passion.</p>
<p>5.) Who are some authors who have inspired you?</p>
<p>Too many to list, but the writers who I think most inspired this story are Alice Munro, David Means, Stephanie Vaughn (in particular her story “Dog Heaven,” which is just such an incredible story), Junot Diaz (especially the stories in Drown), and William Maxwell (especially So Long, See You Tomorrow, which I actually read after I had finished a draft of “The Gully” but which was helpful in revision). I also took a lot of inspiration from the poetry of Richard Hugo and Alice Notley.</p>
<p>More generally, the writers I come back to again and again include Alice Munro, Cormac McCarthy, Roberto Bolaño, and especially Virginia Woolf.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the winner and runner-up of Flyway’s 2014 Sweet Corn Short Fiction Contest!</p>
<p>Mike Alberti’s story “The Gully” was chosen by judge Dean Bakopoulos as our first-place winner. Bakopoulos called this captivating story, about coming of age in Colorado, “a beautifully pensive and lyrical story that understands the complexity of nostalgia — the unbridled human capacity to pine for a place we have fled, to simultaneously love and loathe a place with an intensity that is terrifying and dark.</p>
<p>Alberti is from Albuquerque, New Mexico, and is currently working towards an MFA in Creative Writing at the University of Minnesota, where he serves as managing editor of <i>dislocate</i>, the literary magazine based at his MFA program. As our first-place winner, Alberti will receive a prize of $500 and a box full of delicious Iowa sweet corn.</p>
<p>“Going It Alone,” Laura Price Steele’s story about the choices we do and don’t, can and can’t make, is this year’s Sweet Corn runner-up. Bakopoulos was impressed with Steele’s “convincing narrative voice that is equal parts melancholic and jaded,” and he found the story’s thread, which “lingers around the hard edges of being stuck, with its adrift narrator avoiding a complicated buried truth,” especially compelling.</p>
<p>As runner-up up, Steele will receive a prize of $50. She is originally from Denver, Colorado, and her work has been published in The Oval and Moment Magazine Online. She is currently pursuing her MFA at University of North Carolina, Wilmington.</p>
<p><b>Look for these stories on Flyway’s homepage on July 15, 2014.</b></p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who submitted to our 2014 Sweet Corn Short Fiction Contest. It was a strong pool, and we at Flyway were impressed by and thankful for the good reading!</p>
<p>Finally, we’d like to offer up a special thanks to our excellent and assiduous judge, Dean Bakopoulus.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Adam Blake Wright</p>
<p>I recently suited up, smoked out bees, carved combs, and bottled 40 pounds of honey with ISU’s very own Bluff Creek Bee Club. It was easily my favorite day since moving to Iowa, and yet it made me desperately miss my hometown of Asheville, North Carolina, which is one of the country’s premiere “foodie” capitals. The city has more breweries per capita than any other place in America, and several local chefs recently received James Beard Award nominations for their outstanding culinary work. In celebration (and gentle mockery) of the honey-coated, beer-bloated, quinoa-obsessed foodie culture, here are several pieces that will tantalize the taste buds and tickle the funny bones:</p>
<p>“<a title="Surviving Whole Foods by Kelly MacLean" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kelly-maclean/surviving-whole-foods_b_3895583.html" target="_blank">Surviving Whole Foods</a>” by Kelly MacLean (<em>The Huffington Post</em>)</p>
<p>Comedian Kelly MacLean’s parody of a Whole Foods shopping experience is hilarious and relentlessly unforgiving. It quickly reminded me of the traffic gridlock that was created last week when a Trader Joe’s opened in Asheville, only two blocks from a long-standing Whole Foods. Let the upscale grocery store battle begin!</p>
<p>“<a title="The Ultimate Small Plates Tasting Menu by Kate Hahn" href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-ultimate-small-plates-tasting-menu" target="_blank">The Ultimate Small Plates Tasting Menu</a>” by Kate Hahn (<em>McSweeney’s</em>)</p>
<p>Ah, the joys of paying $27 for a bacon-wrapped grape… Kate Hahn’s fictional menu perfectly satirizes the small plate phenomenon that is a growing fixture of the culinary world. During this tasting, particles of sugar are presented under a microscope and sprayed (literally) into a guest’s open mouth. Bon appétit!</p>
<p>“<a title="Mario's Shoes by Natalie Parker-Lawrence" href="http://www.alimentumjournal.com/marios-shoes-by-natalie-parker/#.Ukn5iOuhBBI" target="_blank">Mario’s Shoes</a>” by Natalie Parker-Lawrence (<em>Alimentum</em>)</p>
<p>I love <em>Alimentum</em>, an excellent literary journal that publishes fiction, nonfiction, and poetry exclusively about food. In this piece, the author clearly has a crush on Mario Batali, the famous Croc-wearing Italian chef and current host of ABC’s The Chew. It’s a delightful read that investigates the sexual and religious undertones that permeate in our age of “food porn.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some links with a bit of heft to keep you through the summer.  by Tony Quick</p>
<p>“<a title="The Outer Reaches of Love" href="http://www.barrelhousemag.com/the-outer-reaches-of-love-by-jp-kemmick/" target="_blank">The Outer Reaches of Love</a>” by JP Kemmick (from <em>Barrelhouse</em>)</p>
<p>Long distance relationships are difficult but what can you do when your wife is an astronaut on a joint American-German research mission and your husband is a superhero? Will they remain faithful? Kemmick’s daringly original short story is a mash-up of the mundane marriage and the fantastic phenomenon of space and super-heroism.</p>
<p>“She’s thinking back to how he tried to tell her what it was like up here, the peace of the infinite, that feeling you get watching the sun rise and set, rise and set; how you worry that the Earth is aging incredibly fast without you and the ridiculous sci-fi fear that you might return to a different era, that everyone will have aged innumerable years without you.”</p>
<p>A definite must read from a writer who is clearly just getting started.</p>
<p>“<a title="The Ghost of Berries" href="http://bostonreview.net/BR38.2/joe_fassler_fiction.php" target="_blank">The Ghost of Berries</a>” by Joe Fassler (from <em>Boston Review</em>)</p>
<p>Lately, my own attempt to write the Great American Famine novel has got me thinking about the luxuries we take for granted. Year-round strawberries, food delivered straight to your doorstep. Fassler’s clearly in the same mode of thought. In his melancholy piece “The Ghost of Berries” a young man goes on a mission to find fruit for his dying mother in a world where there’s little food—let alone produce.</p>
<p>“‘Go out there,’ she croaked. ‘Find me something. Real fruit. An orange. But I’d take an apple. I’d take a single grape. Oh,’ she said, and gave a long, unholy groan, ‘I want to taste real fruit again before I die. I don’t care what you have to do—just get it.</p>
<p>He dabbed the wet rag at her forehead and whispered hushing sounds. But when he finally left the house to pace the open air by the sulfur pits, sucking the pebble he used to stem his cravings, a stuck sob widened in his throat.”</p>
<p>This sparse piece tugs at that muscle in your ribcage and the end packs a guilt-laced punch.</p>
<p><a href="http://flavorwire.com/388428/red-moon-author-benjamin-percys-favorite-wolf-stories" target="_blank">Ben Percy’s Favorite Wolf Stories</a> (From <em>Flavorwire</em>)</p>
<p>Anyone that’s met me knows I’m not above name dropping. Former Iowa State University professor Benjamin Percy has written a werewolf novel <em>Red Moon</em>, a novel that crosses literary fiction and genre. In celebration of a new addition to this talented author’s oeuvre, check out Flavorwire’s profile of Percy’s five favorite wolf novels.</p>
<p><a title="On Craft" href="https://www.graywolfpress.org/blogs/craft-fiona-mccrae-first-pages" target="_blank">On Craft: Fiona McCrae on First Pages</a> (From Graywolf Press)</p>
<p>Speaking of wolves—of a different sort—the Graywolf Press website features a craft lesson from its director and publisher Fiona McCrae on making sure the first few pages of your novel keep the publishers reading.</p>
<p>“Great opening pages, however, are all unlike, and my favorite ones nearly always contain a surprise. The surprise often does not come from language that is forced and straining to impress, but can spring from quite simple phrasing, which nonetheless signals something quite dramatic. Think of Orwell’s clocks striking thirteen at the beginning of 1984, for example.”</p>
<p>The advice is solid and practical. If you’re an aspiring writer, I’d definitely recommend giving it a read.</p>
<p><a title="Contest Submissions" href="http://www.pw.org/content/the_smart_approach_to_contest_submissions" target="_blank">The Smart Approach to Contest Submissions</a> (From <em>Poets &amp; Writers</em>)</p>
<p>Many literary magazines are tied to MFA programs, so many—including Flyway—don’t take submissions during the summer. I always take this opportunity to re-evaluate my strategies and cleaning up bad habits. <em>Poets &amp; Writers</em> magazine has a great seven-point list to help aspiring writers get their manuscripts ready for their date with the editor. My favorite is number 3: Judge your judge.</p>
<p>“Read that famous poet’s work as well as the work of winners that judge has chosen in the past. Read interviews with that well-known novelist, reviews of her latest book, articles and essays she has published in magazines. Try to figure out not only how she writes but also how she thinks, how she reads. Never heard of the judge? Double your efforts and proceed with caution.”</p>
<p>Have fun reading, revising, and since you’re already here, peruse the Flyway website. We’ll be posting content during the summer. Happy reading!</p>

<p>By Tony Quick</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May Day, May Day—Summer Has Arrived</p>
<p>By Tony Quick</p>
<p>This time of year always puts me in a distracted mood. Possibly, it’s the reemergence of steady sunshine, the march towards warm months. In that spirit, this webrove is all over the place—an ADHD extravaganza.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://hhh.gavilan.edu/ksmith/BOOMashortstory.htm" target="_blank">Boom</a>&#8221; by Kimberley Jean Smith</p>
<p>You’ll see the winners of the Sweet Corn Fiction Contest in the fall, but until then you can check out their fiction at other venues. First-place award winner Kimberly Jean Smith’s short story “Boom” brings us into second person POV with a mother who has lost her son to an unfortunate encounter with a firework.</p>
<p>“Where will your ex-husband have been at that very moment? Across the way ordering milkshakes, he will tell you at the hospital, while the doctors try to put your boy’s face together. At the time, it will seem like there can be nothing worse than having a boy with no face. Then they will tell you your boy is dead, and you will see that there is something worse, and you are now living it.”</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.escapeintolife.com/fiction/blown-glass-by-catherine-rose-torres/" target="_blank">Blown Glass</a>&#8221; by Catherine Torres (from <em>Escape Into Life</em>)</p>
<p>“Blown Glass” by our runner-up, Catherine Torres, is the winner of <i>Escape Into Life’s</i> inaugural fiction contest, selected by Pulitzer winner fiction writer Robert Olen Butler. It features a domestic servant, so overworked and underappreciated she forgets her own birthday.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, how old did that make her? She’d heard Mrs Q tell her friends on her birthday—there had been dainty little cakes that looked like little jeweled boxes and coffee that spurted out of a gleaming machine that had sparked a shouting match between Mrs Q and her husband when she bought it—that she’d stopped counting the years when she turned 30. When did she stop counting?”</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://thedoctortjeckleburgreview.com/2013/04/17/science-ends-on-a-backstreet-in-rural-oklahoma/?fb_source=pubv1" target="_blank">Science Ends on a Backstreet in Rural Oklahoma</a>&#8221; by Jade Sylvan (from <em>The Doctor T.J. Eckleburg Review)</em></p>
<p><em>The Doctor T.J. Eckleburg Review</em> features a poem by Jade Sylvan, winner of the 2011 Bayou Editor’s Poetry Prize and author of <em>The Spark Singer</em>. Her poem “Science Ends on a Backstreet in Rural Oklahoma” carries along whimsical carnival electricity:</p>
<p>&#8220;The phenomenon started in the South—the so-called “Quantum Mechanics,” ex-carnies who drifted along old circuits carrying boxes labeled “Schrödinger’s Cat.” Each had a shtick. Bill the Wild Bohr wore a sheriff’s badge and carried flyers, Siamese mug shots that read, “Wanted: Dead or Alive.” Planck’s Constance took bets on her tabby’s heartbeat.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/ocpress/prize.htm" target="_blank">Oberlin College Press FIELD Poetry Prize</a></p>
<p>Have you been sitting on a poetry manuscript? Oberlin College Press has announced their 17th annual FIELD Poetry Prize competition, judged by editors David Young and David Walker. They’re looking for manuscripts between 50 and 80 pages. The winner is published and awarded $1,000 plus royalties. Definitely worth looking at for aspiring and published poets alike.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prada.com/en/journal/terms" target="_blank">Prada International Short Story Contest</a></p>
<p>This next one is for fiction writers. Flyway staff has its fair share of snappy dressers. I’m not one of them. I’ve been wearing the same pair of Converse sneakers for three years and my idea of dressing up is wearing a shirt with two colors in it, instead of my usual monotone. So maybe I’m not the target audience for the Prada international short story contest. But maybe you are. It’s judged by Italian publisher Feltrinelli and has a whopping prize of 5,000 euros—roughly $6,558 American.</p>
<p>The guidelines are a bit strict though:</p>
<p>“Stories must not: be sexually explicit or suggestive… be profane or pornographic… promote alcohol, illegal drugs, tobacco, firearms/weapons (or the use of any of the foregoing), any activities that may appear unsafe or dangerous…”</p>
<p>Like I said, I’m probably not their target audience but if you are, submit!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.missourireview.com/tmr-blog/2013/04/working-writers-series-eric-carter/" target="_blank">Interview with Eric Carter</a> (from <em>The Missouri Review)</em></p>
<p>The Missouri Review has an ongoing series on working writers, men and women who haven’t won major awards and have few publications but are gunning for the keyboard and writing while navigating the working world. This particular interview is with Eric Carter, a self-taught writer and freelance editor who received an honorable mention in the Lorian Hemingway Short Story Competition in 2005.</p>
<p>“I studied architecture at Illinois Central College for a few years and dropped out. It wasn’t the creative discipline I had hoped for, I guess. I remember using the college library to check out books by Margaret Atwood, Ray Bradbury, Edith Wharton, Brian Moore, and Anne Sexton… This was when David Foster Wallace was teaching across town at Illinois State University, but I didn’t know anything about him either. I didn’t know anything and had no one to guide me, but I knew I wanted to write because I was already doing it.”</p>
<p>And now that we’ve run the gamut on the online literary scene it’s time to part ways. Join us next time and keep reading, Flight Patterns—the official blog of Flyway: Journal of Writing and Environment.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Michelle Donahue</p>
<p>I love art. My mother is an artist, so I grew up going to the LA County Museum of Art and ogling all the classical and modern creations there. So I find I’m really drawn to literary magazines that feature art. But what I love even more are multimedia pieces: works that combine a visual aspect with the text. That’s part of the allure for me of online literary journals; without printing costs online journals can print more experimental and multimedia work. I know here at <i>Flyway</i> that’s one of the many reasons we wanted to move online.</p>
<p>So here is a web rove of some recent multimedia pieces from across the Internet. Here we see a poem/video, illustrated fiction, an essay/video game and a schematic. So get ready to read, watch, and play!</p>
<p>“<a href="http://therumpus.net/2013/04/national-poetry-month-day-1-to-find-stars-in-another-language-by-elizabeth-bradfield/" target="_blank">To Find Stars in Another Language</a>” Poem by Elizabeth Bradfield, Video by Demet Taspinar (From <i>The Rumpus</i>)</p>
<p>Bradfield’s poem shines on its own as it explores language and story-telling, but coupled with the video by Taspinar, this work takes on a mythic, abstract quality. The shining water and ice with Bradfield’s well chosen, oh-so wonderful words create a unique experience. So sit back, relax, and watch this poem.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://paperdarts.org/literary-magazine/category/fiction" target="_blank">Evacuees</a>” by Simon Jacobs (From <i>Paper Darts</i>)</p>
<p>Everything in <i>Paper Darts</i> comes with beautiful art, but I particularly love their longer works of fiction that have more than one illustration. “Evacuees” tells the story of two space evacuees. Jacobs packs a lot of punch into a very short a piece, so check out this illustrated short story. Spoiler: Space dragons and David Bowie make an appearance.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://bwr.ua.edu/965/" target="_blank">The Tetris Effect</a>” by Eric LeMay (From <i>Black Warrior Review</i>)</p>
<p>An essay and game hybrid! You begin by playing Tetris and each time you complete a line you get a little more of the essay, which ranges from information on Tetris to personal information about the author who grew up trying to plan and order his life. Just as Tetris is addictive, so is this piece! The author tells us over 35 million games of Tetris are played a day. So why don’t you be part of that number and read this?</p>
<p>“<a href="http://thediagram.com/13_1/somebasic.html" target="_blank">Some Basic Holes and Their Associated Skins</a>” by Roberto Casati and Achille C. Varzi (From <i>Diagram</i>)</p>
<p>I always love <i>Diagram’s</i> “Schematics” section where they feature old art, diagrams, excerpts, etc. “Some Basic Holes and Their Associated Skins” visually and textually explores the idea of surfaces, skins, and being filled.</p>
