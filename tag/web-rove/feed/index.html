<p>Earth Day just passed—Wednesday, April 22. As one of the largest civic holidays around the globe Earth Day is day to celebrate our planet and to rekindle public commitment and activism to saving the earth. Today’s web rove honors several voices seeking to save the places, plants, and animals they love.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/carbon-capture" target="_blank">Carbon Capture</a>” by Jonthan Franzen (from <em>The New Yorker</em>)</p>
<p>In this essay Franzen explores how climate change has made it harder for people to care about conservation. In the following passage he examines his own struggle in grappling with climate change: “But when I started watching birds, and worrying about their welfare, I became attracted to a countervailing strain of Christianity, inspired by St. Francis of Assisi’s example of loving what’s concrete and vulnerable and right in front of us. I gave my support to the focused work of the American Bird Conservancy and local Audubon societies. Even the most ominously degraded landscape could make me happy if it had birds in it. And so I became to feel miserably conflicted about climate change. I accepted its supremacy as the environmental issue of our time, but I felt bullied by its dominance.”</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.ecotonejournal.com/index.php/articles/details/while_our_backs_are_turned/" target="_blank">While Our Backs Are Turned</a>” by Clarisse Hart (from <em>Ecotone</em>)</p>
<p>In this essay Hart writes about her home, Petersham, Massachussetts, which is home to old hemlock forests. As a science communicator, Hart recounts her experience her experiences giving tours in the Harvard Forest, but her essay is an elegy for the disappearing trees. In this passage she describes what it is like to walk into a hemlock grove: “Even if you don’t spend much time with trees, even with your eyes closed, you’re aware when you enter a hemlock forest that you’ve arrived somewhere new. It’s ten degrees cooler than surrounding forests, for one thing, because of the dense shade: only 1 percent of the sun above an intact hemlock canopy reaches the ground at your feet.”</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.rattle.com/poetry/" target="_blank">section b, page 6</a>” by Meryl Stratford (from <em>Rattle</em>)</p>
<p>In this poem Stratford responds to the story “Horseshoe crab faces threats from pollution, development” as a part of <em>Rattle’s</em> online series <em>Poets Respond</em> in which poets address current events. “section b, page 6” asks readers to consider the effects of human desire and consumption on the life of the horseshoe crab. The horseshoe crab was here long before we were, and Stratford calls readers to consider their lives, which have been happening across deep time. “Now they’re making the news: / how we use them as bait, grind them up / for fertilizer, destroy their habitat / but their ancient blood detects endotoxins, / makes possible our flu shots, /pacemakers, and hip replacements.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Meghann Hart</p>
<p>Have you recently spent several hours—more than two, fewer than five—drunk-searching (yes, this is a verb) the Internet for something worthy of your abysmally short attention span? It’s about 2:00 AM, and you know you could be doing something more productive with your life, but you don’t or you can’t—but, really, you won’t. You’ve read at least ten BuzzFeed posts about the infinite health benefits available to those who quaff lemon water intravenously, sleep in the buff, or go paleo. In your darker moments, you’ve watched ten consecutive slide shows that document the thirty-five worst celebrity boob jobs in history, but celebs are doing far more than getting bad boob jobs, folks. A couple of them are writing short stories—that you should read. Good ones. Really. Here they are:</p>
<p><span id="more-4426"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/alan-bean-plus-four" target="_blank">Alan Bean Plus Four</a>&#8221; by Tom Hanks (<em>The New Yorker)</em></p>
<p>This is a tongue-in-cheek, magical real story of four pseudo-astronauts’ brief rub with space—or the moon, to be more precise, in a slap-dash space shuttle named for the fourth man to walk on the moon: Alan Bean. Since the end of his moon-walking days, Bean has become, in the words of the story’s narrator, “as anonymous as a balding orthopedist,” but after the trek of this dynamic dos-duo, and an unexpected crash landing in the Pacific Ocean within snorkeling distance of “the Kahala Hilton,” Alan Bean the space craft will not be soon forgotten, certainly not by the New Yorker’s stellar readership, anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/bungalow-89-0000347-v21n6" target="_blank">Bungalow 89</a>&#8221; by James Franco(<em>Vice)</em></p>
<p>Franco depicts his real, or not so real, or hyperreal, encounter with a troubled starlet, let’s call her Lindsey Lohan, during his stay at “Chateau Marmont,” which Fran-co, the narrator, huskily calls “the old hotel where the stars stay.” In this multi-threaded narrative that winds and re-winds, that backs up one foot, then ten; it’s difficult to say where the story de-picted in the tabloids—Lohan sleeps with Franco; Franco denies sleeping with Lohan—ends, and the actual story begins, which, I suppose, is the point. Though Franco perhaps uses this story as a device to staunchly deny any rumored sexual dalliance with Lohan, Franco the narrator—story Franco—treats this damaged Hollywood darling with notable tenderness; he does the exact thing that every man should do for a world-weary girl-woman. In &#8220;Bungalow 89,&#8221; story Franco reads story Lindsey “A Perfect Day for Bananafish.” “Instead of fucking her,” the narrator says, “ I read her a short story about a neglected daughter.”</p>
<p>Okay. Admittedly the list is brief, but this is the start of something good. A few tabs over, you’ll find the smut that your looking for.</p>
<p>Here’s to the many, countless, wasted hours of drunken Internet adventures to come!<br />
*-*</p>

<p>Nearly a month from today the Association of Writers and Writing Programs Conference (AWP) and Bookfair opens in the Minneapolis Convention Center and Hilton Minneapolis Hotel. I browsed around their website today, itchy with anticipation. The conference website contains a number of fun and helpful links to things like registration, the Bookfair, and info about twin city entertainment. There’s even a “Walk-To Dining Guide” for guests.</p>
<p>I am, to put it delicately, pumped, particularly to walk around and interact with all the awesome publishers and journals. Today’s web rove showcases a handful of pieces from the many wonderful literary magazines and presses that will have booths at this year’s AWP Bookfair.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.sugarhousereview.com/sneak_peek.html" target="_blank">Conversation About Water</a>” by Thea Robin Engst (from <em>Sugar House Review</em>)</p>
<p>In this succinct poem Engst explores illogical fears of the open water. The intensity of her descriptions, “filter teeth lined up like barcodes,” add weight to the ominous tone. But at the same time, she gently mocks herself and her conversation companion by repeatedly describing these fears as “ridiculous.” We laugh too, but cannot hold off a shiver.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://crazyhorse.cofc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/86.Kimbell-Proof.pdf" target="_blank">Orphan Girl</a>” by Naomi Kimbell (from <em>Crazyhorse</em>)</p>
<p>“The sky is coated with scurf the color of tin. Bands of haze hang at the fringe of the valley giving the impression that the mountains have receded into memory. The air is thick and full of grit.” So opens Kimbell’s essay from the current issue of <em>Crazyhorse</em>. Kimbell’s prose is at once crystalline and ambiguous while she discusses coal mining in Montana through its reverberations on her family and the environment.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://greenmountainsreview.com/?p=5078" target="_blank">Do Us Part</a>” by Dawn Dorland (from <em>Green Mountains Review</em>)</p>
<p>Innocuously it begins, “I’ve been wanting to ask you, <em>Do you remember what I said at your wedding?</em>” And from there, in long, image-filled sentences, this simple question complicates. With each rambling line, the tension underwriting the prose tightens. Masterfully, Dorland has us rushing along the story, just as breathless as our narrator until we are left again with another haunting question.</p>

<p>February is over and theoretically spring is right around the corner. March will roar it’s lion howl, then pad softly away on lamb’s feet. It’s a transitional time. We are caught in between. Today’s web rove showcases that period of uncertainty, with narratives of change, hope, and resignation.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.kenyonreview.org/kr-online-issue/2015-winter/selections/saikat-majumdar-342846/" target="_blank">The Firebird</a>” by Saikat Majumdar (from <em>The Kenyon Review</em>)</p>
<p>“But he was just a baby then, they would tell him later, a baby who hadn’t started at the clash of steel. He hadn’t cried. As if he were really asleep! They had been stunned. But the brave sleep had led to nothing.” In this excerpt the character Ori, examines life and death on stage through his mother and his intense desire to act himself. <em>Firebird </em>Majumdar’s upcoming novel will be published May 2015 by Hachette India.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.rattle.com/poetry/stardust-by-colette-tennant/" target="_blank">Stardust</a>” by Colette Tennant (from <em>The Rattle</em>)</p>
<p>In her poem Tennant succinctly and powerfully examines the interplay between scientific terminology and human existence. Somewhat ironically she describes the various objects that comprise the human life while simultaneously proving we are more than our compositions.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.gettysburgreview.com/selections/essays/details.dot?inode=8fd3c9d7-4a4d-4c6f-b8ed-1c3ede948e15&amp;pageTitle=Jeffrey%20Hammond&amp;crumbTitle=Night%20Watch&amp;author=Jeffrey%20Hammond&amp;story=true" target="_blank">Night Watch</a>” by Jeffrey Hammond (from <em>The Gettysburg Review</em>)</p>
<p>“Even a night person will concede that a really dark night, if one can be found, rehearses our future absence. But such a person might counter this gloom with a question: when has so disturbing a lesson ever been conveyed so peacefully and with such beauty?”</p>
<p>Hammond examines the night and how it is perceived through the years and through literature, bringing a contemplative silver lining to our darkest hours.</p>

<p>Of all the written genres, I feel that poetry is closest to visual art. A poet must consider not only the sounds and meanings of their words, but also how they look on the page. The form of a poem can create motion, separation, or sometimes even take on the shape of its subject by creating a literal picture with words.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising then that poetry has inspired great works of art. Scholars suggest Vincent Van Gogh’s famous <em>Starry Night</em> was inspired by section 21 of Walt Whitman’s “Song of Myself”:</p>
<p>“Press close bare-bosom&#8217;d night – press close magnetic nourishing night!<br />
Night of south winds – night of the large few stars!<br />
Still nodding night – mad naked summer night.”</p>
<p><a href="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/starry-night2.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4281" src="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/starry-night2-580x459.png" alt="Starry Night" width="580" height="459" srcset="https://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/starry-night2-580x459.png 580w, https://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/starry-night2.png 774w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night#mediaviewer/File:Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" target="_blank">Starry Night</a>” by Vincent Van Gogh (from Museum of Modern Art, New York City)</p>
<p>However, the door of inspiration swings both ways and many great poets have been inspired by the visual arts. For example, William Carlos Williams “Landscape with the Fall of Icarus” is a direct description of Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s painting of the same name and muses on the artist’s intentions.<span id="more-4275"></span></p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/landscape-fall-icarus" target="_blank">Landscape with the Fall of Icarus</a>” by William Carlos Williams (from <em>Collected Poems: 1939-1962, Volume II</em> published by New Directions Publishing Corp.)</p>
<p><a href="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Icarus.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4282" src="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Icarus-580x370.png" alt="Icarus" width="580" height="370" srcset="https://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Icarus-580x370.png 580w, https://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Icarus.png 728w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_with_the_Fall_of_Icarus#mediaviewer/File:Pieter_Bruegel_de_Oude_-_De_val_van_Icarus.jpg" target="_blank">Landscape with the Fall of Icarus</a>” by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (from The Royal Museum of Fine Arts Belgum)</p>
<p>Ekphrasis derives from the Greek words “out” and “speak” and means a vivid description of a thing. Modern ekphrastic poetry focuses on works of visual art and goes beyond just elaborate description to interpret, inhabit, confront, and speak with the subjects or creators of paintings, photography, or sculptures.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet#mediaviewer/File:Claude_Monet_-_Water_Lilies,_1917-1919.JPG" target="_blank">Water Lilies</a>” by Claude Monet (from Honolulu Museum of Art)</p>
<p><a href="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Monet.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4283" src="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Monet-580x287.png" alt="Monet" width="580" height="287" srcset="https://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Monet-580x287.png 580w, https://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Monet.png 874w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/236810" target="_blank">Monet Refuses the Operation</a>” by Lisel Mueller (from <em>Second Language</em> by Louisiana State University Press)</p>
<p>The impressionist painter, Claude Monet, known for his water lilies and studies of light, suffered from cataracts later in life which affected his vision. Many believe this also affected his paintings. Lisel Mueller takes the reader to the moment of diagnosis in “Monet Refuses the Operation.” Rather than delving into a single painting, Mueller explores Monet’s large body of work, “Fifty-four years before I could see / Rouen cathedral is built / of parallel shafts of sun, / and now you want to restore / my youthful errors: fixed / notions of top and bottom, / the illusion of three-dimensional space, / wisteria separate / from the bridge it covers.”</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/article/241798" target="_blank">Visualizing Words and Worlds: Teaching students to see good writing through what’s around them</a>” by Andrew Zornoza (from <em>Poetry Foundation</em>)</p>
<p>“What does poetry teach us? A new way of seeing, I think. But we rarely teach it that way,” writes Andrew Zornoza in his essay “Visualizing Words and Worlds: Teaching students to see good writing through what’s around them.” Zornoza explains how he teaches poetry by breaking it down into visual components and literally drawing it out on the chalk board. In a sense, Zornoza performs the opposite of ekphrasis by turning the spoken/written into a visual medium.</p>
<p>Morphing the visual into words or words into the visual challenges us to see something in a new way, asks us to delve a little deeper, and speak out what we find inside.</p>

<p>I love television for both the long story and loyalty to the characters. Television is also able to help us discover something new about our lives and the state of our culture, from the Japanese nuclear disaster at Fukushima to the aftermath of September 11. In the links below, commentators discuss shows by Aaron Sorkin that blend reality and fiction in ways that are poignant, heart-breaking and beautiful. Similarly, in an interview about the new series <em>Fresh off the Boat</em>, Eddie Huang discusses his struggle to watch a sitcom based on his life and memoir of the same name. What happens when life and art collide?</p>
<p>&#8220;<a title="The West Wing" href="http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/the-west-wing-isaac-and-ishmael-57428" target="_blank">The West Wing: Isaac and Ishmael</a>&#8221; by Steven Heisler (<em>AV Club</em>)</p>
<p>While author Steve Heisler didn&#8217;t care so much for this episode, “Isaac and Ishmael,” it&#8217;s still important to note when it aired: &#8220;Less than a month after September 11th 2001.&#8221; According to Heisler, this special episode occurred as a type of play between the intense end of the first season and before season two began. It isn&#8217;t as well-crafted as other episodes, but it was an opportunity for television to respond to tragedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a title="Best Moments of Newsroom" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-best-moments-from-the-newsroom-season-one-20130714" target="_blank">The Best Moments From &#8216;The Newsroom&#8217; Season One</a>&#8221; by Julian Ring (<em>Rolling Stone</em>)</p>
<p>This article is an overview of season one of <em>News Room</em>, giving video highlights for those unfamiliar with the show. Episode Six is the one to pay attention to: &#8220;Bullies,&#8221; where character Sloan Sabbith reports on the Japanese nuclear disaster at Fukushima. This episode dramatized the idea: What would it be like to report on a moment like this?</p>

<p>We are still living with the fallout of the Fukushima disaster, as seen in this &#8220;Letters From Japan&#8221; feature in <em>Harper&#8217;s. </em>The most startling image, and there are many, is of the seemingly endless pile of orange persimmons laid out along a lake; they were deemed too radioactive to eat.</p>

<p>The new ABC sitcom, &#8220;Fresh off the Boat&#8221; is responding to real events in a different way. Eddie Huang&#8217;s memoir <em>Fresh off the Boat</em> was adapted for ABC and as this NPR interview shows, he struggles with this adaptation.</p>

<p>I always feel a sense of wistfulness when, at hotels and airports, I pass the booths that used to house pay phones. The phones themselves are gone, but the smooth metal banks that housed them remain—left to provide privacy for cell phone calls, but feeling more like memorials to a former way of life.</p>
<p>Today’s web rove features stories that reflect on the passing of payphones and landlines, and on the strange mix of intimacy and anonymity, of connection and disconnection, that went with them. If cell phones and social media remind us of the interconnectedness of human societies, landlines were a reminder of the opposite: of the tenuousness of human connection, the fickleness of affection, the joy of reconnection. These are eulogies: to lost modes of communication, to lost youths, to lost visions of the world.</p>
<p><a title="Serial" href="http://serialpodcast.org/" target="_blank">Serial</a> by Sarah Koenig (from NPR)</p>
<p>I was reminded of the culture of landlines and public payphones while listening to Serial this winter. In case you are one of the few people who haven’t yet heard it, NPR’s wildly popular and highly addictive podcast—a spinoff of This American Life—explores a 1999 murder in 12 in-depth installments. Producer Sarah Koenig features Adnan Syed, who was a high school senior in Baltimore when he was accused and convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend. Much of the evidence in the case rests on cell phone tower records—a new and difficult-to-understand technology at the time—and the presence of payphones at a local Best Buy, long since removed from the store with little record that they ever existed at all. <span id="more-4109"></span><!--Continue reading--></p>
<p><a title="&quot;Landlines&quot;" href="http://brevitymag.com/current-issue/landlines/" target="_blank">“Landlines”</a> by Lisa Nikolidakis (from Brevity)</p>
<p>“His voice was warm and low, breathy as a runner’s, and we’d smash our ears against the receiver to hear him.”</p>
<p>Nikolidakis’ haunting flash nonfiction piece recounts the author’s experience as a teenage girl receiving “dirty calls” at a public pay phone in a mall with her friends. Nikolidakis captures the thrill of the illicit, the sense of possibility and hint of danger in anonymous communication.</p>
<p><a title="Time and Distance" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102235226" target="_blank">Time and Distance Overcome</a> by Eula Biss (via NPR)</p>
<p>Biss’ rightfully-lauded lyric essay merges the early history of the telephone with the almost-immediate appropriation of telephone poles as tools for lynchings, exploring the dichotomy between the need for human connection, and the cruelty of which humans are capable when they do come together.</p>
<p><a title="Funeral for a Friend" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/magazine/31fob-medium-t.html?_r=0" target="_blank">“Funeral for a Friend”</a> by Virginia Heffernan (from the New York Times)</p>
<p>“A conversation could last hours upon dazed hours, as you sat on your parents’ bed, twirling the curly cord, or hauled the house phone into the bathroom, the better to monopolize family telecommunications. Chortling, gasping, sighing, sobbing, throats catching or forming word after idle or impassioned word: you made every sound that humans make and thus joined your solitudes.”</p>
<p>Heffernan’s short piece for the New York Times remember and eulogizes the physicality of landlines, the pleasures of receivers that could be hung up—softly, angrily—and the lost sensory experiences of landlines.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving has come and gone leaving me longing for stuffing, gravy, mashed potatoes, and warm apple pie. Thankfully with the December holidays fast approaching, we have more opportunities for all sorts of roasts and sweets. But I know that holiday cooking and eating, while wonderfully gluttonous, can also be a source of tension as a guest and host if you have vegans, vegetarians, and other diets to worry about at the table. So today I want to offer some of those stories as well as possible solutions and recipes for your holiday dining predicaments.</p>
<p>“<a title="Recipes for a Fun-Filled Thanksgiving" href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/recipes-for-a-fun-filled-thanksgiving" target="_blank">Recipes for a Fun-filled Thanksgiving</a>” by Molly Schoemann (from McSweeney’s Internet Tendency)<br />
These snarky, but sadly relatable stories include three recipes: Tell Me Again Why We are Driving Nine Hours to See People We Both Hate Spiced Pumpkin Pie, You Didn’t Tell Me Your New Girlfriend was a Fucking Vegan Quick ‘N’ Easy Green Bean Casserole, and Everyone Get the Hell Out of the Kitchen Right Now Before I Kill All of You Cranberry-Orange Dressing. As I’m sure you can tell from the preceding titles, she captures the headaches and agonies of Thanksgiving with relatives and new significant others with dietary restrictions.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">“<a title="Gluten Free" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/11/26/366304008/gluten-free-guests-for-thanksgiving-we-ve-got-you-covered" target="_blank">Gluten-free? Vegan? Thanksgiving Recipes for Alternative Diets</a>” by NPR staff (from NPR’s The Salt)</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">While Schoemann’s narratives are too often true, NPR’s staff has put together a list of classic dishes with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free alternatives with the help of America’s Test Kitchen host, Chris Kimball. I have also turned to the New York Times also publishes a wealth of vegetarian recipes submitted by readers in <a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/445045-wells-vegetarian-thanksgiving" target="_blank">Well’s Vegetarian Thanksgiving</a>. This is a great resource for inventive dishes for the holidays. For example, last week I made Jeff Mauro’s recipe for <a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015362-cranberry-brie-arepa" target="_blank">Cranberry Brie Arepas</a>, small Venezuelan corn flatbread sandwiches with creamy brie, tart cranberry sauce, and peppery arugula greens dipped in spicy mustard. Delicious!</span><span id="more-4086"></span></p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.saveur.com/article/Kitchen/Inside-Story" target="_blank">Inside Story</a>” by Colman Andrews (from Saveur)<br />
My two personal favorites at the holiday table include stuffing and gravy. When people hear that I’m a vegetarian around Thanksgiving they often ask what I do without turkey, stuffing, and gravy. The truth is, I don’t miss the turkey (I always avoided it as a kid by hiding it under my leftover mashed potatoes), and I don’t go without stuffing or gravy. In “Inside Story” Colman Andrews argues that real point of the holiday feast is not the bird, but the stuffing inside it, which I completely agree with. My favorite stuffing recipe, which is cooked outside of the bird, comes from one of my favorite food bloggers, Deb Perelman, of <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/11/apple-and-herb-stuffing-for-all-seasons/" target="_blank">Smitten Kitchen</a>. This savory stuffing complete with caramelized onions and tart granny smith apples is perfect for your holiday feast. I’ve never looked back at Stovetop again!<br />
Finally, I want to offer you my favorite new addition to the table—garlicky mushroom gravy with a red wine sauce. I created this recipe for a cooking class I’m teaching at Ames’ local co-op, Wheatsfield, offering recipes to welcome vegans and vegetarians to your holiday table.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Garlicky Mushroom Gravy</span></p>
<p>by Kristen Daily</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>Roux&#8211; 4 tablespoons butter and 6 tablespoons flour (Earth Balance non-hydrogentated margarine can be substituted for butter to make this vegan)<br />
¾ cup full bodied, dry or semi-dry red wine (merlot or cabernet sauvignon works well)<br />
1 cup vegetable broth<br />
3 tablespoons soy sauce<br />
½ teaspoon thyme<br />
½ teaspoon rosemary<br />
8 oz mushrooms, chopped (I used cremini, but I’m sure other mushrooms would work too!)<br />
3 cloves garlic, minced<br />
Salt and pepper to taste<br />
1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil for sauteing mushrooms</p>
<p>Directions: (This can be made the day before the meal and be refrigerated and reheated.)</p>
<p>To make the roux, heat butter in small saucepan or skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Add flour all at once and whisk vigorously and continuously until the mixture is smooth. When mixture thins and starts to bubble, reduce heat to low and continue cooking until you smell a toasty aroma. Set aside and allow to roux to cool to room temperature before adding it to the gravy.</p>
<p>Saute mushrooms in a large skillet over medium-high heat until they are nicely browned. Add in salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, and minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Next, pour vegetable broth, soy sauce, and wine over the mushrooms and allow mixture to simmer for several minutes (approx. 3-5 minutes). Take off heat and whisk in roux. Blend with immersion blender until smooth. Serve warm over a vegan celebration roast (or meat, potatoes, or stuffing) and enjoy!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Kelly Slivka</p>
<p>Sometimes, you just need to curse. I love cursing. I choose my curse words carefully, loading them with as much vitriol and shock value as possible. It’s good to be shocked, to be uncomfortable, to be taken to the edge of your tolerance. This is where you uncover yourself and where you grow. This is the frontline, where it all happens.</p>
<p>As my mom’s motto about children went when I was growing up, “Keep their hands dirty and their minds disturbed.”</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.tinhouse.com/magazine/current-issue.html" target="_blank">Mothers, Lock Up Your Daughters Because They are Terrifying</a>” by Alice Sola Kim (from <i>Tin House</i>)</p>
<p>This is a masterful story told from the perspective of punchy young girls who are recounting their dangerous and magical grade-school gallivanting. The style is sort of journalistic, sort of confessional-istic, sort of stream-of-consciousness. It’s wry and blunt and wild – channeling spirits, getting liquored up, abusing stereotypes. Be prepared to be taken for a ride.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.bu.edu/agni/essays/print/2000/51-daynard.html" target="_blank">Time Has a Color</a>” by Jodi Daynard (from <i>AGNI Online</i>)</p>
<p>Despite my mother’s fierce motto about disturbed minds, my childhood was pretty vanilla. There was no yelling in my house, no door-slamming, and no cursing. No cursing <i>ever</i>. So I am perfectly enthralled by this essay about growing up in a crazy house – <i>This can’t be true!</i>, I found myself thinking over and over again as I read it. The essay is rugged and brutally honest, and it made me think about how I edit my personal history in my mind to remove all the difficult and awkward moments, however vanilla they were. Daynard apparently hasn’t, and I’m so thankful.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://garev.uga.edu/donohue.pdf" target="_blank">Russell and Mary</a>” by Michael Donohue (from <i>The Georgia Review</i>)</p>
<p>When it was published in 2007, this essay won a National Magazine Award, and it won’t take you long to understand why. In this essay, the author catalogs some of the things left behind in his Park Slope apartment building after his colorful landlady passes away. He describes boxes of pornographic cartoons and disturbing news clippings and inter-splices these descriptions with the narrative of his late landlady and her troubled late husband.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.poetrynw.org/tod-marshall-never-one-to-paint-space-i-paint-air/" target="_blank">Never One to Paint Space, I Paint Air</a>” by Tod Marshall (from <i>Poetry Northwest</i>)</p>
<p>This suicide-themed poem is small on the page, but don’t let its physical size fool you. Depending on who you are and what your story is, there’s a good chance you will feel the seize of a sob on your second read-through and perhaps close the tab before you get to your third read-through. But that’s good poetry – after you’ve seen it once, it will illuminate you no matter how hard you try to shut the window.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Kelly Slivka</p>
<p>I don’t actually listen to opera. Sure, I have a few songs in my iTunes library – an album of Pablo Neruda’s poetry sung by Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, a track of Por Ti Volare sung by Andrea Bocelli (which I only bought because of Will Farrell’s performance in the movie “Step Brothers”) – but I wouldn’t call myself a fan.</p>
<p>However, this could soon change. The universe is guiding me toward the opera, it seems of late. I chanced upon tickets to a showing of Puccini’s <i>Madame Butterfly</i>, I’m dating someone who sings opera, and I’ve been enraptured by recent creative pieces themed on the opera.</p>
<p>So in celebration of what is perhaps my new hobby – opera music – I’d like to share these fantastic opera-laced creative pieces from the interwebs.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.vqronline.org/poetry/2014/10/pl%C3%A1cido-domingo-northbound-train" target="_blank">Plácido Domingo on the Northbound Train</a>” by Jehanne Dubrow (from <i>The Virginia Quarterly</i>)</p>
<p>This poem is magical for me. Not only is it the kind of poetry I typically read and write – a casual and accessible narrative – but it passes through dreams, through lifetimes, and through generations using straightforward words and images. It reminds me of a haiku, in that it captures a moment so precisely it’s almost painful to behold: effort, idealism, reality, exhaustion. I rarely see the human condition painted with such simple piquancy.</p>
<p><a href="http://threepennyreview.com/lesserblog/" target="_blank"><i>The Lesser Blog</i></a> by Wendy Lesser (from <i>The Threepenny Review</i> online)</p>
<p>This is a blog written exclusively by <i>The Threepenny Review</i> editor Wendy Lesser. Lesser is a huge fan of classical music, and she writes often about opera, especially Handel, with whom she is madly in love. Even though I’m not an opera aficionado, I get a kick out of reading Lesser’s entries. Her enthusiasm is scintillating, and touring her blog is like getting a window into strange new world with its own vocabulary and history and gods. If you need to brush up on your opera to impress a crush or an in-law or a boss, this is the spot to do it.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://blackbird.vcu.edu/v12n2/nonfiction/hower_e/echoes_page.shtml" target="_blank">Echoes</a>” by Edward Hower (from <i>Blackbird</i>)</p>
<p>An opera singer reviews the major and minor events of his career and his time at the New York City Opera in this work of nonfiction. I like this piece, because as with <i>The Lesser Blog</i>, you get a window into an esoteric world. You get the language (<i>basso profundos</i>) and you’re literally behind the scenes at the opera. You also see things in this esoteric world that are familiar to all of us – first-day jitters, on-the-job mistakes, competition, and frustration.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.bu.edu/agni/poetry/print/2002/56-dischell.html" target="_blank">Ellipsis, Third or Fourth Dot, Depending</a>” by Stuart Dischell (from <i>AGNI Online</i>)</p>
<p>This is a great poem. I like the way it flows down so quickly, breathlessly, like falling. I like the opera fantasy in it. The words <i>basso profundo</i> crop up again, but you are prepared for it now after reading Edwar Hower, above. The things this narrator wants to be – in a carnival, in an opera, in a garden, in the clouds, part of the neighborhood. Lastly, I like how this poem connects the opera, which I see as so unapproachable, to the simplest things. As I’ve said, I’m beginning to rethink my stance on the opera.</p>
