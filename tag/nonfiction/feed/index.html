								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chilly fall weather and the growing darkness have you huddling inside? Open up the latest edition of <i>Flyway</i> and let the electricity of our new content exhilarate you from head to toe.</p>
<p>Whet your artistic palate with our fresh visual art. Kristi Beisecker creates scintillating photograms by exposing organic objects to electricity and capturing the interaction on photosensitive paper. And take your time with Laurence Holden’s abstract paintings, which seem to glow from the inside.</p>
<p>On our poetic front, Donna Vorreyer takes you to the modern countryside in her poem “Foreclosure Pastoral.” Kirby Snell ponders a pelican carcass in “<i>Pelecanus occidentalis</i>.” And Kat Lewis prods the make-up of our intimate relationships in “We Are on Vacation” and “Our Lady of the Rockies Suddenly Reminds Me of You.”</p>
<p>On our prose front, fiction writer Elizabeth Rodriguez tells a tale you can’t stop reading in her short story “Three.” It’s about immigration, abuse, refuge, and hard choices. We have a special nonfiction feature by Cristina Eisenberg, judge of our 2014 Notes from the Field Nonfiction Contest (open for submissions until November 10). She writes about the science of climate change through the lens of old-growth forests in her essay “Environmental Writing and the Ecology of Hope.” Also in nonfiction, Sarah Robinson investigates the human perception of place during her travels through the American Southwest in “The Space of Desire.” And Mike LeSuer skewers pop culture’s infringement upon nature in “The Implicit Dangers of the Rogue Juice Box.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diane Ott Whealy&#8217;s <i>Gathering: Memoir of a Seed Saver</i><br />
Review by Dana Thomann</p>
<p>Wilsted &amp; Taylor Publishing Services, 2011<br />
$25</p>
<p>A young man and a young woman marry. They move around the United States following odd jobs in their tiny Volkswagen Beetle in the 1970s. Life seems haphazard and inchoate, but a theme emerges in each place they live—an appreciation for discovering heirloom fruits, vegetables, and seeds. Diane Ott Whealy’s, <i>Gathering: Memoir of a Seed Saver, </i>is a reminder that good things aren’t built in a day, and it is sometimes unclear where passions and persistence will lead. Ott Whealy chronicles the beginnings, struggles, and successes of what becomes the world-renowned nonprofit Seed Savers Exchange, co-founded with Kent Whealy. The seemingly haphazard and humble beginnings that develop page by page make <i>Gathering: Memoir of a Seed Saver</i> rewarding to read.</p>
<p>The impetus for a seed exchange began with Ott Whealy’s ancestors from Bavaria. Their heirloom morning glory seeds were brought to North America and passed from generation to generation. Ott Whealy collects some seeds from her paternal grandparents to ensure their survival. An idea is sparked. Whealy wonders if others who save heirloom seeds would be willing to exchange to keep genetic diversity strong. In 1975, Whealy and Ott Whealy establish a small seed exchange with 29 gardeners. The following year, the exchange grows to 142 interested people. Suddenly Ott Whealy finds her home brimming with heirloom seeds, and this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>The importance of genetic diversity grows as hybrid seeds start to take over seed catalogs in the 1980s. Exchange of heirloom seed becomes not only recreational, but necessary preservation. Others begin to recognize Whealy and Ott Whealy for their efforts: an article in <i>Organic Gardening</i> magazine in 1981, a MacArthur “Genius Grant” in 1990, a Martha Stewart visit in 1999, the acquisition of Heritage Farm in 1987, and 716 contiguous acres to build what is known today worldwide as Seed Savers Exchange in Decorah, Iowa.</p>
<p>While Whealy seems to be the face of Seed Savers Exchange, without Ott Whealy Seed Savers Exchange would never have become a reality. She is a true pioneer in her field. Not only does she raise five children as they build Seed Savers Exchange from the ground up, she becomes an influential businesswoman in the process. For this reason, Ott Whealy becomes a sort of seed saving heroine—the book a celebration of all the roles women fill.</p>
<p>In an excerpt titled “Growing Pains” Ott Whealy describes her precarious balance between motherhood and non-profit accountant. “One year, a tax due date and my due date coincided. But before Jessica Lee Whealy was born on April 5, 1988, I made sure the federal and FICA taxes had been sent in.” Ott Whealy describes her many roles with a little humor and a lot of dutiful respect to the mission of Seed Savers Exchange.</p>
<p>The book does slow in some points. At moments, it reads as a thank-you card to the many people who made Seed Savers Exchange what it is today. Ott Whealy often takes a few lines to thank people. “Over the next four years, many people contributed to the effort. Kent applied his editing skills, Arllys Adelmann typed all the extensive revisions, and Steve Demuth was the technical consultant. David Cavagnaro took hundreds of photographs&#8230;” All the names can be a bit overwhelming, but remembering each name is not critical to appreciating the book as a whole.</p>
<p>The organization of the book can also be confusing at times. While the story is told mostly chronologically, it deviates at points, which makes it hard to follow the timeline of events leading to the development of Seed Savers Exchange. Redeeming the book from these minor flaws are lines laden with vivid sensory details. “The air smelled of freshly turned earth. Before long, we took off our shoes and walked—we practically waded—in the soft, cool Iowa earth.” The book’s beautiful layout, illustrations, and photographs reminded me of a child’s storybook, of entering a lush garden.</p>
<p>But while the aesthetically pleasing memoir may call to mind the feel of a children’s picture book, the larger emotional conflict of <i>Gathering: Memoir of a Seed Saver</i> grapples with mature themes, of letting go, and of hopefulness for the future. The ending invites readers to think about the personal sacrifices they would be willing to make for the sake of the greater good.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web Rove: Northern Exposures<br />
By Meg Brown</p>
<p>Popular imagination regards North Dakota and the surrounding northern plains region as sparsely-populated and culturally homogeneous “flyover country,” home to little else but wheat fields and prairie dogs. However, writers and artists who visit this country have long recognized the northern plains as a place of subtle beauty and tempered grace. Shaped by an increasing demand for energy and food, the northern plains region now plays a critical role in our nation’s economic and environmental future.</p>
<p>“<a title="The Emptied Prairie" href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/01/emptied-north-dakota/bowden-text.html" target="_blank">The Emptied Prairie</a>” by Charles Bowden and Eugene Richards (from <em>National Geographic</em>)</p>
<p>The northern plains region has been plagued for decades by “brain drain” – the outmigration of young educated people to large cities in other states, leaving a dwindling population and all-but-abandoned towns. In “The Emptied Prairie,” Charles Bowden takes us on a bleak tour of western North Dakota’s ghost towns. Don’t miss the gallery of chilling images from photographer Eugene Richards.</p>
<p>“<a title="The New Oil Landscape" href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/bakken-shale-oil/dobb-text" target="_blank">The New Oil Landscape</a>” by Edwin Dobb and Eugene Richards (from <em>National Geographic</em>)</p>
<p>When Eugene Richards returned to photograph western North Dakota in 2012, he encountered a far different story. With the advent of the technology needed to recover an estimated seven billion barrels of crude oil in the Bakken oil shale formation, North Dakota became the #2 oil-producing state, second only to Texas. Recession refugees from across the country flocked to the region by the thousands in search of oil industry jobs. Now the fastest growing state in the nation, North Dakota’s population is projected to grow 20% by 2020, and the influx has already caused housing shortages in cities as far east as Grand Forks and Fargo. Meanwhile, the use of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) brings the looming threat of pollution and permanent, catastrophic environmental damage.</p>
<p>“<a title="North Dakota's Oil Boom" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2013/03/north-dakotas-oil-boom/100473/" target="_blank">In Focus: North Dakota’s Oil Boom</a>” by Alan Taylor, Jim Urquhart, and Shannon Stapleton (from <em>The Atlantic</em>)</p>
<p>Ironically, the outmigration of young people due to “brain drain” meant that the few residents remaining in western North Dakota were people who were happy with the way things were. All but assured of the permanence of their lifestyle, they made their homes on the rural plains only to have their landscape rendered almost unrecognizable by the oil industry. It’s hard for outsiders to appreciate the enormity of the changes wrought upon the region now called “Kuwait on the prairie.” Barring a trip to visit it in person, this series of thirty photographs from <em>The Atlantic</em> might be the second-best way to witness a region in the grip of an unprecedented oil boom.</p>
<p>“<a title="The Same Cold" href="http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2012/02/19" target="_blank">The Same Cold</a>” by Stephen Dunn (from <em>The Writer’s Almanac</em>)</p>
<p>Residents of the northern plains have a saying: “Forty below keeps the riff-raff out.” Long winters and famously brutal cold define the climate of the northern plains, and certainly influence the social “climate” as well. In this poem, Stephen Dunn offers a convincing explanation for the well-documented phenomenon called “Minnesota Nice.”</p>
<p>“<a title="Indian Summer" href="http://www.americanlifeinpoetry.org/columns/233.html" target="_blank">Indian Summer</a>” by Diane Glancy (from <em>American Life in Poetry</em>)</p>
<p>The northern plains are a place of contradictions: an ever-present cycle of change coupled with a sense of retrogression and permanence. Diane Glancy, an indigenous voice and one of my favorite authors, captures these competing qualities in “Indian Summer.” She is not alone in her visualization of the prairie as “a horizon, an open sea” – at once a place of timelessness and new possibilities.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eden from the Ashes<br />
A Review of Maleea Acker’s <i>Gardens Aflame: Garry Oak Meadows of BC’s South Coast</i><br />
by Stefanie Brook Trout</p>
<p>Last winter, New Star published the twenty-first book in their twenty-one-year-old “Transmontanus” series:  Maleea Acker’s <i>Gardens Aflame: Garry Oak Meadows of BC’s South Coast </i>(2012).  Like the rest of the books in the series, <i>Gardens Aflame</i> is short (97 pages), illustrated (with black and white images, mostly photographs), and focused on a unique aspect of life in British Columbia (a special ecosystem I didn’t know existed).</p>
<p>In <i>Gardens Aflame</i>, Acker raises awareness about the human role in creating the Garry oak meadows.  Acker seeks to teach readers a lesson about “how to live in the world” through a close study of the contested meadows. “This book could have been written about my lost Douglas fir and arbutus forest,” Acker writes.  “It could have been written about our urban creeks—Bowker, Millstream, Craigflower—or about the Southern Gulf Islands’ aquamarine coves and shell beaches.”  But it wasn’t.  Acker focuses on the Garry oak meadows because “it is an ideal microcosm for examining the aesthetic, ethical and economic preoccupations that have dogged our species.”  The complex historical interplay of humans and nonhuman nature makes the Garry oak meadows worthy of Acker’s close examination.</p>
<p>The First Nations created the Garry oak meadows though careful cultivation and management.  Fire was the crucial element to the genesis of this ecosystem:  “Before the arrival of Europeans, fires, both naturally occurring and set by First Nations, rolled through Garry oak meadow ecosystems at three- to five-year intervals: a process the Cowichan call ‘sweetening the ground.’”</p>
<div id="attachment_1644" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_fire.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1644" class="size-medium wp-image-1644" alt="Cowichan Garry Oak Preserve (Maleea Acker)" src="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_fire-580x435.jpg" width="580" height="435" srcset="https://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_fire-580x435.jpg 580w, https://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_fire.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1644" class="wp-caption-text">Cowichan Garry Oak Preserve (Maleea Acker)</p></div>
<p>The meadows were gardens that fed human populations but also served as hosts to biodiversity.  Hundreds of plant and insect species, plus various birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians still call the meadows home, though many are now at risk thanks to the invasive Scotch broom, house sparrows, and English ivy—not to mention a host of other problems including fire suppression.  When Europeans settled the land, they removed the delicate balance that had worked for thousands of years.  Though the gardens reminded the Europeans of the pastoral English countryside, it didn’t occur to them that the gardens could be anything but pristine wilderness.</p>
<p>By now, many meadows have been lost to development, but many more were lost due to neglect, settlers not realizing the responsibility they had to cultivate and manage the land in the absence of the First Nations.  Without humans playing their role, the Garry oak meadows ecosystem could not sustain itself.  Recent restoration efforts have successfully saved some of this diminishing ecosystem.  Restoration is a complex effort, however, complicated by competing aesthetic values.  “Essentially, to think of restoration, we are forced to consider not just how it should take place, but in whose image it should be made.  As ecologist Dave Polster said […], when we restore an ecosystem we are always playing God; to move forward, we must admit this, and somehow decide to get on with the work.”  Bold gardeners like Acker have gotten on with the work and cultivated Garry oak meadows in their front yards—to the unfortunate dismay of neighbors and bylaw enforcement.  Instead of seeing the landscape as an Eden like the European settlers, many today see only weeds in the prairie grasses.</p>
<p>Acker organizes <i>Gardens Aflame</i> into six chapters, each exploring a different aspect of the Garry oak meadows’ significance.  Photographs and illustrations accompany historical quotations, Acker’s dated journal entries, and the narrative that links all of these pieces together in a patchwork meditation on a specific place at a specific point in time.</p>
<div id="attachment_1643" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_tree.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1643" class="size-medium wp-image-1643" alt="The Giant Cowichan, Garry Oak Preserve (Maleea Acker)" src="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_tree-580x435.jpg" width="580" height="435" srcset="https://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_tree-580x435.jpg 580w, https://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Acker_review_tree.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1643" class="wp-caption-text">The Giant Cowichan, Garry Oak Preserve (Maleea Acker)</p></div>
<p>In the epilogue of <i>Gardens Aflame</i>, Acker addresses<i> “</i>the crux of this story: we love what is beautiful, as so many have argued.  We love what is rare and fleeting.”  Acker argues a place like the Garry oak meadows “gives us not just physical sustenance, but a sense of emotional or spiritual connection and belonging to the place we live,” and she supports this claim with experiential evidence—not just her own but that of First Nations and those European settlers who followed as well.</p>
<p>In <i>Gardens Aflame</i>, Acker explores the paradox of humans’ role in natural environments:  “Wherever humans had landed and stayed in stable, resident populations for the longest time,” like the First Nations, “fewer plants and animal species had become endangered.  This opposes the views of environmentalists who favour wilderness parks as untouchable refugia for nature.  It questions the thinking that to truly care for a place, we must leave it alone.”  Humans evolved with our natural environments, altering them without always destroying them, sometimes improving them in the ecological sense of the word.  Acker issues a call to action to her readers; she writes, “As gardeners, we must cut the branch, pull the weed, shape the look and feel of a landscape.  We must participate.”  In this way, nature takes on a democratic world.  Wildness is not something merely to be observed; humans have the power and thus the onus to create it.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in the Midwest all of my life and have never been to British Columbia; I’ve never seen a Garry oak meadow except through Acker’s words and images.  But <i>Gardens Aflame</i> is relevant to my life, as it will be to yours no matter where you live.  The book is a case study of one ecosystem, but Acker draws conclusions with implications for a global audience.  Better known for her verse, Acker brings her poet’s pen to nonfiction and shows readers a new way of nature writing, acknowledging that humans too are a product of nature.</p>

<p>Iowa State University, <em>Flyway</em>&#8216;s bricks and mortar home, is currently hosting our <a href="http://engl.iastate.edu/programs/creative_writing/mfa/visiting-writers-series/9th-annual-symposium-on-wildness-wilderness-the/" target="_blank">9th Annual Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness &amp; the Environmental Imagination</a>.  This year&#8217;s theme, &#8220;The Future of Water,&#8221; has attracted some of today&#8217;s most important and imaginative writers thinking about our relationship with our planet&#8217;s most essential element.  For our readers who are unable to attend, here&#8217;s a web rove focusing on those writers.  The Symposium wraps up this weekend with a Kinship of Rivers event out at the Casey Nature Preserve on Sunday (April 7th), and a reading on Monday evening (April 8th) featuring authors Rick Bass and Wang Ping.  Come if you can, and if you can&#8217;t, this web rove will give you a taste of the deep, refreshing waters we&#8217;ve been swimming in.</p>
<p>Charles Fishman, excerpts from <a href="http://www.walmarteffectbook.com/excerpts.html" target="_blank"><em>The Wal-Mart Effect</em></a></p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2004, seventy percent of all new retail jobs created in the United States were Wal-Mart jobs.  Wal-Mart shapes where we shop, the products we buy, and the prices we pay — even for those of us who never shop there.  Read excerpts from one of <em>The Economist</em>&#8216;s Best Books of 2006, and decide for yourself how much you should be paying attention to what&#8217;s going on with this mega-corporation.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Bradfield,<i> &#8220;</i><a href="http://www.ebradfield.com/poems/solitude.shtml" target="_blank">Against Solitude</a><i>&#8220;</i></p>
<p>From her collection <em>Approaching Ice</em>, which she read for us at the Wildness Symposium.  This web page has links to some of her other poems, too: some uncollected, some from <em>Approaching Ice</em>, some from <em>Interpretive Work</em>.  &#8220;Against Solitude&#8221; will convince you, no matter how much of a loner you are.</p>
<p>Sherwin Bitsui, &#8220;<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/182473" target="_blank">River</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>The word &#8220;river&#8221; is a verb.  From his collection <em>Shapeshift.</em></p>
<p>Julia Whitty, <a href="http://deepbluehome.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Deep Blue Home</a></p>
<p>Julia Whitty&#8217;s book <em>The Fragile Edge</em> has been described as &#8220;a natural history, a call to action, a love song, and a prayer.&#8221;  Her latest book <em>Deep Blue Home: An Intimate Ecology of our Wild Ocean</em> will change how you think about our oceans.  &#8220;Deep Blue Home,&#8221; linked above, is her blog site.  Also of interest is her latest <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/02/navy-climate-change-great-green-fleet" target="_blank">article in Mother Jones</a> on how the US Navy is reducing energy consumption, decreasing reliance on foreign oil, and significantly increasing the use of alternative energy &#8211; changing the energy game across the globe.  Her <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2010/09/bp-ocean-cover-up" target="_blank">article on the Deepwater Horizon</a><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2010/09/bp-ocean-cover-up" target="_blank"> oil spil</a>l was one of the most important pieces of reporting to come out of that disaster.</p>

<p>Multi-talented poet, musician, and muse, Joy Harjo shares some secrets in this audio interview she did with NPR.  The webpage also includes a link to excerpts from her new book <em>Crazy Brave</em>.</p>
<p>Wang Ping, <a href="http://www.kinshipofrivers.org/" target="_blank">Kinship of Rivers project</a></p>
<p>Kinship of Rivers is a five-year interdisciplinary project to build kinship among communities along the Mississippi and Yangtze Rivers, and raise awareness about the rivers&#8217; ecosystems through art, literature, music, food, and the installations of river-flags made by river communities.  Learn about this unique and visionary project and how it&#8217;s inspiring people living on opposite sides of the planet.</p>
<p>Rick Bass, &#8220;<a href="http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/winter-2012/gettysburg" target="_blank">Gettysburg</a>&#8221; (in <em>Narrative</em>)</p>
<p>&#8220;He’s not a fool. He’s foolish, but not a fool. He knows he’s on thin ice, soulwise; he knows that his soul has gone underground for a while, has gone to sleep, but he can’t think of how to wake it up.&#8221;  Access to this short story requires signing up for <em>Narrative</em>, &#8220;a non-profit dedicated to the best in storytelling.&#8221;  Signing up is free, and you get to read a whole lot of really good writing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Stefanie Brook Trout</p>
<p>As a reader, I don’t usually think about authors’ gender.  Obviously gender often colors our perspectives, and the gendered perspective can be important in analyzing texts, but in terms of what I like to read, gender is irrelevant.  Yet for some reason I found myself drawn to women writers this week.  Each of the writers I have featured explores in some way what it means to be a woman, specifically in the face of change.  I hope you enjoy these nonfiction, fiction, and poetry selections as much as I did, regardless of your gender.  Happy reading!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/newsfrom187/entry/6799/" target="_blank">“Breaking Up with the Sierra Club”</a> by Sandra Steingraber (<i>Orion</i>)</p>
<p>In this open letter, the author of <i>Living Downstream</i> ends her fourteen-year relationship with the Sierra Club.  The Sierra Club once embraced Steingraber as “the new Rachel Carson” but has recently been caught in bed with (i.e., taking millions of dollars from) Chesapeake Energy.  What the frack?  Instead of merely indicting the Sierra Club, however, Steingraber calls for “reparations” and reflection on what John Muir, the Sierra Club’s founder, would say if he could see his brainchild now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.triquarterly.org/nonfiction/woman-writer-aging" target="_blank">“A Woman Writer Aging”</a> by Toi Derricotte (<i>TriQuarterly</i>)</p>
<p>In this wonderfully written essay, Derricotte considers the entropy of the body with age but also the growth of the soul that accompanies such decay.  The problems associated with aging are often exacerbated for women and then again for writers, but Derricotte has found a way to turn base metal into gold.  Here’s a glimpse at one of her many brilliant insights about overcoming self-loathing:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was working with my young assistant today, laughing and complaining about my over-the-top commitments, and she said, also laughing, that’s the price you pay for ambition.  And it stays in my mind, that these long hours each day and through the night, for all these years, consistently performing my tasks, going down my list of commitments, responding in the most efficacious way to letters, requests, e-mails, phone calls, writing recommendations, reviews, evaluations, calling people, even for the friendliest reason, putting myself in the position to be visible, has been excruciating.  I who have spent my life not only responding but, first, before responding, double-checking myself again to make sure everything is spelled right, everything sounds intelligent, everything does not reek of my stupidity or anger or want.  I who have so carefully phrased my want, so terrified that a ragged longing might make itself evident.</p></blockquote>
<p>I raggedly long for you to read this essay in its entirety.  It will be time well spent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.massreview.org/sites/default/files/Valios.pdf" target="_blank">“Good Form”</a> by Michelle Valois (<i>The Massachusetts Review</i>)</p>
<p>“Good Form” is composed of two parts, the creative nonfiction essay “Why You Write Sestinas” and the poem “The Burdened Sestina.”  The narrator is an English teacher, a writer, and a cancer patient.  She writes sestinas for her students, for her partner, for her doctors, for other patients, and for herself.  She writes sestinas because “all cancer patients have a story to tell, even if it is just muttered in their sleep or whispered late at night in their lover’s ear or scribbled in journals never to be read.”  Who knows?  Maybe “Good Form” will compel you to write sestinas to tell your own story.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quarterlywest.utah.edu/iss_77/iss_77_fourteentipsfor.html" target="_blank">“Fourteen Tips for Selling Real Estate”</a> by Dana Fitz Gale (<i>Quarterly West</i>)</p>
<p>In this short story, Gale satirizes the patina of normalcy and dispassion the aged must superimpose upon their homes in order to sell them to a new generation.  To pretend that your identity is not tied to a place is challenge enough without disease, in this case Alzheimer’s, further complicating the issue.  This story manages to be funny, sad, and heart-warming all at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.threepennyreview.com/samples/gluck_sp13.html" target="_blank">“Approach of the Horizon”</a> by Louise Glück (<i>The Threepenny Review)</i></p>
<p>In this poem, Glück compares life to a “short flight” into the horizon, “At which point my soul will have merged / with the infinite, which is represented / by a straight line, / like a minus sign.”  The poem is essentially a meditation on the end of life.  But for me, the extended metaphor and the other uses of well-crafted figurative language in this poem evoked neither a sense of despair or disappointment nor a sense of inspiration but rather a matter of fact appreciation for the facts—what <i>is</i>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maya Khosla won Flyway’s “Notes from the Field” contest with her piece “Notes from the Eastern Edge of Time: A Turtle Diary.”  Ms. Khosla was gracious enough to share with Flyway editors some of her thoughts on environmental writing, turtle conservation, and the possibility of hope for future generations.</p>
<p><strong>Flyway: Give us some background on the piece.  Do you have a background in herpetology, or the biological sciences? Have you been involved in turtle projects in the past, or was this your first experience with sea turtles?</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1061 alignright" alt="Arribada 2013" src="http://flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Arribada-Kartik-2.jpg" width="480" height="360" /></strong></p>
<p>Maya Khosla: I have been lucky enough to work on animal surveys and rescues in California for several years— mostly on special status salmonids, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, on occasion, mammals (my graduate work was in toxicology). I saw Rita Banerji’s film &#8220;The Right to Survive,&#8221; some time in 2009. The film is a vivid report on the natural history of olive ridley turtles, conservation challenges, conflicts and livelihood issues faced by fishing communities in the east coast state of Orissa. I was immediately interested in documenting the larger context of sea turtles and conservation.</p>
<p>My family is based in New Delhi and I travel to India on a regular basis. By 2010, Rita and I were talking about The Turtle Diaries Project. That winter I sent a proposal to Save Our Seas (SOS) Foundation, hoping for the seed funds to begin the project. The idea was to collaborate with Dusty Foot Productions (founded by Rita and another filmmaker, Shilpi Sharma) and we tossed my draft proposal back and forth across the internet ether, since I was still working in the States. Well, we won the first SOS award in May 2011 (and another one in 2012). With SOS support, I flew to India and began co-directing <a href="http://saveourseas.com/projects/turtle_diaries" target="_blank">The Turtle Diaries Project</a>. This has been my first experience working on sea turtles.</p>
<p><strong>Flyway: How did your field experience with the turtles shape this piece? What did you leave out of the piece, and why?</strong></p>
<p>MK: Field work in India is no cakewalk. Depending on where you are, mosquitoes, sandflies and leeches are among the less pleasant aspects; there are also crocodiles and snakes as well as the not-so-remote possibility of a tsunami. I have nothing but admiration for India’s field biologists and assistants (Agu, a field assistant from the Andaman Islands, had malaria seven times during one season and returned to field work each time). This <a href="http://saveourseas.com/projects/turtle_diaries/the_turtle_diaries_a_page_in_motion" target="_blank">five-minute film clip</a> features a group of field researchers.</p>
<p>Also, there’s a lot of permit issues to negotiate. It took us two months and three separate trips to the east coast to obtain the permits to be there for the <em>arribada. </em>(Luckily Rita’s co-worker Sumit had the time and persistence to make two of those trips). On the first night of the <em>arribada</em>, the Forest Department folks did not allow us entry to the turtle island/sandbar. So we missed the most dramatic night of mass nesting in 2012. I guess that’s another turtle story!</p>
<p>To their credit, the Forest Department has been trying for years to get major factories to shut down their lights for those few nights when sea turtle eggs hatch and hatchlings waste a lot of energy straying towards lights instead of crawling towards the sea. So far the Department has met with no success. Those details will be in the film.</p>
<p>What else did I leave out in my story? A lot! During the <a href="http://saveourseas.com/projects/turtle_diaries/the_toughest_turtle_diary" target="_blank">2012 mass hatching</a>, hundreds upon hundreds of hatchlings were hopelessly trapped in nets left out on the beaches. Many field teams spent inordinate amounts of time disentangling them. Needless to say, not all the hatchlings could be saved and relocated.</p>
<p><strong>Flyway: How do you understand environmental writing? Who are some authors or pieces that have influenced your own writing? How do you overcome the difficulties involved in environmental writing?</strong></p>
<p>MK:  To me, environmental writing is a way to engage the reader with an experience that will hopefully foster a deep respect for the natural world and translate into some form of action. It’s also a balance between the science and the value systems that are geographically specific— and ever in flux! The fabric of tension has to hold a story from beginning to end and of course, it has to be accurate. Given these demands on the narrative, I am delighted when a certain internal music flows through the form (it’s a personal choice—I wrote poetry for years before I began writing essays).</p>
<p>The risks include the possibility of antagonizing someone with the truth, with descriptions of field experiences. Also, it’s quite typical for scientists to be uncomfortable with poetic language, while most essayists seem to want more.</p>
<p>How do I overcome the difficulties of creative writing? Just keep writing. As Junot Diaz said, “You discover you are a good artist when everything goes wrong and it keeps going wrong, and you hang in there.” The more I write, the more I learn how to separate better pieces from ones that simply don’t hold together. And that advice Mary Oliver gives, about spending a few choice hours everyday? It’s the best advice.</p>
<p>Recently, I have also been inspired by Andrew Todhunter (“Dangerous Games”), the poet Pattiann Rogers (“Firekeeper”), Carl Safina (“Voyage of the Turtle”), Annie Dillard (“Pilgrim at Tinker Creek”) and by Eric Wagner’s penguin story.</p>
<p><strong>Flyway: Do you have suggestions for further reading for people who are interested in sea turtles and conservation? What, if anything, can people do to help keep sea turtles from going extinct?</strong></p>
<p>MK: In terms of sea turtle conservation, I greatly value the work and writings of Drs Kartik Shanker, Bivash Pandav, and Rohan Arthur, scientists in India who work actively with coastal communities to spread awareness through scientific studies. Kartik Shanker provides coastal community members with seasonal employment as well. I am particularly intrigued by his vision—to be the “substrate for a revolution and not the revolution itself” (I am paraphrasing him). Of course I also admire Dr. J. Nichols, Scott Eckert, Karen Eckert and others based in the U.S.</p>
<p>It’s tricky to work on turtle conservation in areas of India where most residents are poor fishermen. As in other parts of the world, it’s the trawlers that cause the most damage in India’s waters (trawler boats belong to the wealthy). The traditional fishing practices of small boats owners are relatively harmless to sea turtles. According to Bivash Pandav, avoiding sea turtle congregations in the sea could save thousands of turtles that end up trapped and drowning in trawler nets. Apparently the carcasses are tossed off those boats.</p>
<p>In some countries, the governments are using GPS devices to nab illegal trawlers. To my knowledge, India is not there yet.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1062" alt="Arribada 2013" src="http://flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Arribada-sea-5.jpg" width="480" height="285" /></p>
<p>What can we do to save sea turtles? Spreading awareness through reporting and filming can go a long way, as some of us know from films like “The Cove.” If permits permit, there’s room for more people to guide hatchlings to sea by flashlight. I do have hope in the children— if ecologists are there to train them and to oversee relocation activities. And climate change? My understanding is that it’s about to have a huge impact on life as we know it—and not just on the sex ratio of sea turtles in India and Australia. Putting a halt to the current pace of climate change may be one of our biggest battles.</p>
<p><strong>Flyway: How do we go about making a world that we can pass on without shame to our children?</strong><br />
MK: It’s a collective effort— a critical mass of humanity is required. We’ve got miles to go before we achieve that critical mass. It can happen.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“<a title="A Girl Who was the Victim of a Flood" href="http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v11n2/poetry/levis_l/flood_page.shtml" target="_blank">A Girl Who Was the Victim of a Flood</a>” / by: Larry Levis (poetry in <em>Blackbird</em>).  The writers I work closely with in the MFA program here have water on the brain lately (and always). This waterlogged poem demonstrates the awful with a cool, heartbreaking distance.</p>
<p>Here are a few poems by Derek Sheffield, a poet whose work I was introduced to recently via Verse Daily.</p>
<p>“<a title="The World's Other Side" href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/240496" target="_blank">The World’s Other Side</a>” / by Derek Sheffield (poetry on The Poetry Foundation website).  A loss poem about the faraway, what we can’t see or seem to understand.</p>
<p>“<a title="An Accurate Account of the West" href="http://www.poetserv.org/SRR16/sheffield.html" target="_blank">An Accurate Account of the West</a>” / by Derek Sheffield (poetry in <em>Salt River Review</em>).  Another poem by Derek Sheffield because I have been interested lately in the history of the American west.</p>
<p>“<a title="Delicious Apocalypse" href="http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/poem/4946/" target="_blank">Delicious Apocalypse</a>” / by Derek Sheffield (poetry in <em>Orion</em>).  Who doesn’t love an apocalypse poem?</p>
<p>“<a title="Cut-Off Russian Family" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/For-40-Years-This-Russian-Family-Was-Cut-Off-From-Human-Contact-Unaware-of-World-War-II-188843001.html#ixzz2KBAQ1qR7" target="_blank">For 40 Years, This Russian Family Was Cut Off From All Human Contact, Unaware of WWII</a>” / Mike Dash (nonfiction in <em>Smithsonian Magazine</em>).  And now for some nonfiction! This article in <em>Smithsonian Magazine</em> went viral recently, but I can’t resist posting it here, too. The story details a six-person family isolated in Siberia for decades with no other human contact. It describes the interactions between Soviet geologists and the family when the scientists stumble upon them in 1978. Everyone who reads this article is completely amazed by this family and their story.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philip Roth is getting a PBS documentary, George Saunders just published a new short story collection <em>Tenth of December</em>, and David Sedaris is getting a film adaptation. The established writers (and retirees) and starting off 2013 strong. But I want to hone in on new talent this week, get a glimpse at the writers that’ll be lining your bookshelves in ten years (or hopefully less!). You’ll be able to tell your friends with a hipster-esque pride that you read these writers before the book tours and accolades.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.gulfcoastmag.org/index.php?n=24" target="_blank">“Personal Statement”</a> poetry by Claire Sylvester Smith (in <em>Gulf Coast</em>). Smith is an emerging poet whose work is forthcoming in <em>Boston Review, Colorado Review, </em>and <em>Barn Owl</em>. “A darkling mechanical/sense lives within me and asks to see the ceilings of my church…”</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.gulfcoastmag.org/index.php?n=2&amp;si=49&amp;s=3096" target="_blank">An Interview with the 2012 Gulf Fiction Prize Winner, Geetha Iyer</a> (in <em>Gulf Coast</em>)<br />
While we’re on <em>Gulf Coast</em>, I can’t help notice the interview with the winner of the 2012 Gulf Fiction Prize. Did I mention that winner is Iowa State University’s own Geetha Iyer? Read along to hear Iyer discuss her short story “The Glass World Builder” with Gulf Coast Senior Editorial Assistant Kim Vera.</p>
<p><a href="http://brevitymag.com/current-issue/the-first-time-i-had-sex/" target="_blank">“The First Time I Had Sex, My Mouth Was Numb”</a> nonfiction by Kyra Anderson (in <em>Brevity</em>).<br />
Anderson teaches us the power of attention grabbing titles with her short non-fiction piece. The piece is an endearing account of losing her virginity after visiting the dentist’s office. Her work has appeared in <em>Tiny Lights</em> and <em>Flash Fiction</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bodegamag.com/articles/15-pamachapuka" target="_blank">&#8220;Pamachapuka,&#8221;</a> fiction by Jon Steinhagen (in <em>Bodega</em>)<br />
Steinhagen refers to himself as a playwright first, but his story in the excellent new online magazine <em>Bodega</em> is a short, funny piece about moving the unmovable. When a giant glacial boulder begins to move, it and its history take a toll in two interwoven narratives.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the talented men and women carving out their place in the arena of letters. Hopefully we’ll be seeing much more from each of them in the future. Continue reading Flyway blog for more fledgling talent and established hard hitters. See you next week!</p>
