								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week our staff selects material from a range of different genres, all somehow related to how we make resolutions, and, sometimes, what it means to fall short. So go green or go home, run toward or away….or just read through our latest web rove.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><a href="http://grist.org/living/the-greenie-pigs-guide-to-a-cleaner-more-sustainable-2013/">“The Greenie Pig’s guide to a cleaner, more sustainable 2013”</a> by Elisabeth Kwak-Hefferan (from <em>Grist</em>)<br />
It wouldn’t be a new year without pledges to do better this time around. These five guidelines will help you green your routine whether you’re still us<br />
ing plastic bags or if you’re a freegan.</p>
<p><a href="http://hippocketpress.org/canary/index.php#242">&#8220;Flee&#8221;</a> by Catherine Owen (from <em>Canary</em>)We like how the author represents &#8220;us&#8221; (humans-as-readers) as both something to flee from (as in the deer from the car) and entities that contain selves-of-wildness along selves-slated-to-be &#8220;stuffed, extinct&#8221; in this poem.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thewritingdisorder.com/fictioneight.html">“Neighborly”</a> by Frances O’Brien (from <em>The Writing Disorder</em>)<br />
This flash fiction story is told through the eyes of a woman with questionable sanity but who can only see herself as the victim of the injustice her new neighbors have inflicted.  A humorous voice carries the reader through.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.riverandsoundreview.org/Poetry/Issue7/CReillyYawning.htm">&#8220;The Opposite of Yawning is Holding Your Breath&#8221;</a> by Christine Reilly (from <em>A River and Sound Review</em>)<br />
This six-part poem lets us eavesdrop on that conversation between opposites we&#8217;re always holding within ourselves. But which side to choose? For the pill-popper, Reilly hints, perhaps it doesn&#8217;t matter. Anything to be on the outside of the pendulum, away from that center when we can fully see.</p>
<p><a href="http://brevitymag.com/current-issue/perdition/">“Perdition”</a> by Kristen Radtke (from <em>Brevity</em>)<br />
This graphic essay is as wonderfully surprising as it is brief and simple.</p>
<p><a href="http://issuu.com/bloodlotus/docs/bl26_final/49">&#8220;The Way You Look in Morning&#8221;</a> by Matthew Brown (from <em>Blood Lotus</em>)<br />
A rare type of relationship-poem that manages to be tender but feature barbed wire, and, like the fence &#8220;meant neither/to hold something in, nor to keep it out&#8221;, never explicitly mentions the Other.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our fiction editor, Lydia Melby, offers some reading suggestions for all things fairy tale. Too cold outside? Stay in and stoke your imagination with this week&#8217;s web rove, full of interviews, novel excerpts, reviews, and even a web comic.</p>
<p>-*-</p>
<p>If you arent reading Electric Literature&#8217;s &#8220;Recommended Reading,&#8221; then you&#8217;ve got some serious catch-up to play. I love this blog as much for the recommender&#8217;s notes as for the brilliant, and usually new to me, stories or excerpts they suggest. Here are some recommendations:<br />
<a href="http://recommendedreading.tumblr.com/post/37784039877/dan-josefson-feeling">Dan Josefson&#8217;s </a><em><a href="http://recommendedreading.tumblr.com/post/37784039877/dan-josefson-feeling">That&#8217;s Not a Feeling</a>, </em>_novel excerpt<br />
Here, Soho Press and Tom Bissell suggest an excerpt from Dan Josefson&#8217;s <em>That&#8217;s Not a Feeling</em>&#8211;and yes, this brief taste suggests the book is just as good as everyone and their mother has suggested.</p>
<p><a href="http://recommendedreading.tumblr.com/post/28479950929/steven-millhauser-cathay">Steven Milhauser&#8217;s &#8220;Cathay&#8221;</a><br />
Here, Aimee Bender recommends surreal master Steven Milhauser&#8217;s strange and wondrous world, narrated in mysteries.</p>
<p><a href="http://recommendedreading.tumblr.com/post/34697098370/j-robert-lennon-cottage-hill">J. Robert Lennon&#8217;s &#8220;The Cottage on the Hill&#8221;</a><br />
And finally, J. Robert Lennon&#8217;s quietly unsettling story offers one much to ponder, and is suggested by the new journal <em>Unstuck.</em><em></em></p>
<p>*<br />
Speaking of <em><a href="http://unstuckbooks.org/">Unstuck</a>,</em> our fiction editor would like to point out it&#8217;s the journal she&#8217;s currently most excited about. They explain themselves on their website as an &#8220;independent, non-profit annual journal&#8221; dedicated to literary fiction with elements of the fantastic, the futuristic, or the surreal&#8230; In our pages, you&#8217;ll find everything from straight-up science fiction and fantasy to domestic realism with a twist of the improbable.&#8221;</p>
<p>While you&#8217;ll have to subscribe to get the full wondrous experience, <em>Unstuck</em>&#8216;s website provides <a href="http://www.unstuckbooks.org/interviews-excerpts">excerpts and interviews</a> that will just make you want more.</p>
<p>*<br />
If you&#8217;ve got that constant fairy tale itch, like some of our staff, here&#8217;s a great <a href="http://onpoint.wbur.org/2012/10/17/grimm-brothers-fairy-tales">NPR podcast with Tom Ashbrook and Maria Tatar</a> (high queen of fairy tale scholarship) discussing fairy tales and their history in celebration of her new translation, &#8220;The Annotated Brother&#8217;s Grimm (The Bicentennial Edition).&#8221; Depending on your obsession, you may have come across some of the things and themes covered, but overall it&#8217;s a lovely and interesting discussion of the bedtime tales still affecting us today. <span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> </span></p>
<p>*<br />
<a href="http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=1132&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media=">Jill Steinhauer, &#8220;The Gorey Details&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Jill Steinhauer reviews Edward Gorey&#8217;s works and influence on her and many of us, offering an insightful, interesting discussion of his art, his mystery, and, well, his gorey-ness (pun intended!), ultimately offering us an peek into the artist&#8217;s &#8220;theory of life&#8221; as &#8220;inexplicable&#8221; put into striking, memorable art.</p>
<p>Also, the Los Angeles Review of Books is such a perfect place to read about all the books and art and themes of life you&#8217;ve always wanted to see discussed.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><a href="http://hemlock.smackjeeves.com/comics/893745/0-00/"> &#8220;Hemlock,&#8221; Joscelyn Fenton</a> (web comic)</p>
<p>For our readers who love graphic novels and comics as well as the written word, here&#8217;s a great web comic (still updating!) about a Scandinavian country witch named Lumi (whose house is built into the shell of her giant snail). &#8220;Hemlock&#8221; plays on the well-loved Baba Yaga myth, but Lumi&#8217;s story is fresh, fun, and exciting (and quite visually gorgeous).</p>
