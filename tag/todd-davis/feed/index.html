								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Review and Republishing of Todd Davis&#8217;s Poems: &#8220;Learning to Read&#8221; Vol 9.1 and &#8220;Some Heaven&#8221;Volume 8.1/8.2 Spring /Fall 2003</p>
<p>by Erin Schmiel</p>
<p>I love how easily Todd Davis expresses themes of spirituality in his quiet nature poems. He says, in &#8220;Learning to Read,”: “I understand that learning to read,/like so much of life, is about faith and doubt —/the possibility of one, the heaviness of the other.&#8221; In just three narrative stanzas we see the progression from the oblivion of the 5 year old narrator: &#8220;my joy when you told me/I was driving, too young to realize you held /the wheel&#8221;, to the responsibility of road markers: &#8220;signs /sprouted like goldenrod and Queen Anne&#8217;s lace, and you/demanded I read them, pretending not to know/what to do if I didn&#8217;t.&#8221; The final stanza carries the reader forward from this scene and out into the world knowing that what has been said is as true for them as it was for the father and son.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Some Heaven&#8221; the narrator is a father watching his child pray for &#8220;some heaven/that has no fences,&#8221; after they find a rabbit &#8220;caught between the slats of the fence,” that he has had to kill. I feel he is asking for forgiveness, too, when he believes his child&#8217;s &#8220;prayer is right/ What more should heaven be? /A place made/ of wild carrot and dill…a warm October/day that never ends.&#8221;</p>
<p>These words cut me to the quick with their urgent, yet natural spirituality. I had to pause and say —yes— this is the way of it not only for the lives in the poems, for me the reader as well.</p>
<p>Both poems are republished below with permission from the author. <span id="more-4406"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Learning to Read&#8221; by Todd Davis</p>
<p>Before seatbelt laws and airbags began to pull</p>
<p>families apart, you let me ride up front, seated</p>
<p>between your legs. My joy when you told me</p>
<p>I was steering, too young to realize you held</p>
<p>the wheel below, was incommensurate with the act.</p>
<p>But what more does a five year old wish for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the back roads of Michigan, signs sprouted</p>
<p>like goldenrod and Queens Anne&#8217;s lace, and you</p>
<p>demanded I read them, pretending not to know</p>
<p>what to do if I didn&#8217;t. The weight of your words</p>
<p>was nothing like the impress of the declarations</p>
<p>written in bold black on yellow, or the infinite space</p>
<p>white made when placed on a metal so red</p>
<p>children at slumber parties would tell stories</p>
<p>of the dead whose blood colored it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, the weight I carried came from the letters</p>
<p>whose meaning I worked hard to explicate, trying</p>
<p>to understand how they offered either absolution</p>
<p>or extinction—our very future depending upon</p>
<p>how I sounded out S-T-O-P. Knowing now</p>
<p>you would have stopped whether I could read</p>
<p>the sign or not, I understand that learning to read,</p>
<p>like so much of life, is about faith and doubt—</p>
<p>the possibility of one, the heaviness of the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some Heaven&#8221; by Todd Davis</p>
<p>The rabbit&#8217;s head is caught</p>
<p>between the slats of the fence,</p>
<p>and in its struggle it has turned</p>
<p>so now the hind legs nearly touch</p>
<p>the nose—neck broken, lungs failing.</p>
<p>My boys ask me to do something</p>
<p>but see no mercy in my plan</p>
<p>to make sure the animal is dead.</p>
<p>At four and seven, they are so far</p>
<p>away from their own deaths</p>
<p>that they cannot imagine</p>
<p>the blessing a shovel might hold,</p>
<p>nor the lesson suffering offers</p>
<p>to those who have not suffered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At bedtime, my youngest prays</p>
<p>the rabbit is in some heaven</p>
<p>where there are no fences, where</p>
<p>in death there is more than enough</p>
<p>to eat. He begins to cry, and we rock</p>
<p>until sleep&#8217;s embrace takes him</p>
<p>from me. Sitting on his bed, I know</p>
<p>his prayer is right. What more</p>
<p>should heaven be? A place made</p>
<p>of wild carrot and dill, sunflower</p>
<p>and phlox, fields the stretch on</p>
<p>for miles, every coyote full, every</p>
<p>hawk passing over, a warm October</p>
<p>day that need never end.</p>
