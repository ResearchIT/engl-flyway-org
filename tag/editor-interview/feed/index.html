								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Place, image, rhythm, and balance are all integral to poetry. And when it comes to poetry, William Bonfiglio, one of <i>Flyway</i>’s two-prong poetry editorial team, brings a sharp eye and musicality to the table. A trained opera singer, accomplished dramatist and poet, William sat down with me for an interview last week to talk about his reading sensibility and his role as a poetry editor for <i>Flyway</i></p>
<p>“What I look for in poetry is a strong setting filled with lovely details. What we [Samantha Futhey, <i>Flyway</i>’s second poetry editor] look for is a complete piece, a story that is dependent on place, where place is a character — it should be treated as a fully-developed character. We pride ourselves on the poetry we publish, that it’s complete and polished for publication.”</p>
<p>Before entering Iowa State University, William earned his undergraduate degree at Bucknell University, where he studied with writers Paula Closson Buck and Shara McCallum.</p>
<p>“It was incredibly intimidating to be in that setting,” he said.</p>
<p>After Bucknell, William spent a gap year working the late shift at a supermarket. It’s this time that William says was his most productive writing period: he’d wake each morning and write before heading into his 2 to 9 p.m. shift. During this time William also traveled to Nova Scotia, read numerous poets and prose writers, and spent time in reflection, which solidified his conviction to pursue writing, eventually leading to his enrollment in Iowa State University’s Creative Writing and Environment program.</p>
<p>When asked about his views on environment in writing, William remarks, “When you volunteer for a journal of writing and environment, the stigma is that “environment” has to be some profound or progressive idea, when in fact, environment can be interpreted as simply as the idea of place, and the role that setting plays within inspiring stories and poetry and works of creative nonfiction. Personally, my writing has always been influenced by the place where I grew up, which spans everything from the East Coast to the home in which my parents raised me.”</p>
<p>Both Futhey and William are excited about upcoming content for <i>Flyway</i>. William describes many of the submissions to the magazine as “gifts” and says that it feels good to share these authors with the wider reading world.</p>
<p>So why serve as poetry editor? William remarks that so many writers have low self-esteem and little confidence &mdash; and that reading new material for <i>Flyway,</i> and the ability to see a wide scope of great writers, has made him more confident in his own writing.</p>
<p>“As a writer, I’m reading to better myself, to see other approaches by other writers,” he says.<i> </i>“I often ask myself what makes something memorable. I’m after that in my own writing and the writing we publish at <i>Flyway</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Flyway</i>: In a couple of sentences, share something about your background—writing related or not.</p>
<p>CK: I created and operated a yellow milk-crate library as a kid. I taped makeshift Dewey-decimal-system identifiers to the spines of my books and &#8220;loaned&#8221; them out to my sister and parents, and—if I recall correctly—attempted to institute fines. It didn&#8217;t last, but I still LOVE libraries!</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What book can you not stop talking to people about?</p>
<p>CK: Year in and year out, since reading William Gibson&#8217;s <i>Neuromancer</i>, it&#8217;s always wiggling its way into discussions (mostly in my head, but—yes—also with others) about the intersections between psychology, technology, communication, and architecture in the future. So, basically, any chance to make it relevant, I take!</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What book inspires or compels your writing?</p>
<p>CK: The more I write, the more I realize how inescapable the experiences and ingrained aesthetics of childhood really are. A book that changed how I viewed words—and what I wanted to get out of their arrangement in books—is <i>The Crown Snatchers</i>, by F. K. Waechter and Bernd Ellert. At the time it was, for me, innovatively subversive, challenging, and rewarding—a combination of story and illustrations that were questions themselves. Though I&#8217;m not exactly creating graphic poetry, I try to channel that feeling by writing in a way that lets people figure something out about their own minds, their own emotions, their own inner workings. A more genre-relevant, current writer I&#8217;m really enjoying is Rita Dove&#8230; about a poem a day hits the spot and inspires.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What literary magazines (other than <i>Flyway</i>) do you read?</p>
<p>CK: Thanks to social media, I like skipping around via friend-recommended poems and then digging into the parent magazine. Regular reads include <i>Rattle</i>, <i>Ecotone</i>, <i>Black Warrior Review</i>, <i>Gulf Coast</i>, and <i>Diagram</i>. <i>Wag&#8217;s Revue</i> has featured some refreshing art.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</p>
<p>CK: I don&#8217;t feel I can properly answer this question with specific names—both because it changes all the time, and because I&#8217;m a connectionist, always seeking novel variations on the same good words and ideas; names I recognize and respect guide me into magazines which are publishing relatively new voices that are likely to offer similar quality, resonance, voice, or value.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: Is there an aspect of the writing life, or the writing industry, that deserves more attention than it gets?</p>
<p>CK: Book cover design does so much work to make or break a book, in my opinion. It&#8217;s so much more than a graphic art—the psychology behind a successful designer encompasses an intimate understanding of everything from industry trends to the season&#8217;s &#8220;fashionable colors.&#8221; There&#8217;s definitely rising interest in, and appreciation for, this art—and maybe it&#8217;ll be a way to preserve the physicality of books even when the pages are in some electronic tablet. Maybe we&#8217;ll wear their visual representations on our walls as art? Check out the LA Times&#8217; &#8220;<a title="Best Book Covers of the Year" href="http://www.latimes.com/features/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-the-best-book-covers-of-the-year-selected-by-designers-20130626,0,1404191.photogallery" target="_blank">Best Book Covers of the Year.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What advice do you have for potential-contributors of Flyway?</p>
<p>CK: I want to be surprised; I want to be delighted. I want to wake up thinking about how the parallels you drew—the metaphors you implied—were as obvious, as genius, as concrete, but so completely original that jealousy and reverence are the only possible reactions. Do the work to incite an epiphany between my own neurons, tricking me to thinking it was my own—and leave me with a sweet but intrigued taste in my mouth. But most of all, I want your words to plant an understanding of how it feels to love the world like you do.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What extinct animal do you wish could be revived, &amp; why?</p>
<p>CK: Probably the pterodactyl (but only temporarily, for ethical don&#8217;t-mess-with-time-travel-and-evolutionary-order reasons). I&#8217;d wonder if other birds would freak out or somehow respond to it. And: if you cut it, would it bleed&#8230; warm or cold? (<a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news63081.html" target="_blank">2013 University of Adelaide research</a> indicates: warm).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this first of an ongoing series &#8220;Meet your <em>Flyway</em> Editors,&#8221; our new Managing Editor Michelle Donahue talks about talking about books, &#8220;Keeping up with the Kardashians,&#8221; and why she&#8217;s so excited for this new publication year.</p>
<div id="attachment_2192" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/michelle-donahue-180.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192" class="size-full wp-image-2192" alt="Michelle Donahue, Managing Editor" src="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/michelle-donahue-180.jpg" width="180" height="180" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2192" class="wp-caption-text">Michelle Donahue, Managing Editor</p></div>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: In a couple of sentences, share something about your background &#8211; writing related or not.</p>
<p>MD: I’ve got a background in science. I have a bachelors in environmental biology, have taken ecology classes in three countries, and did some National Park volunteer work in the Galapagos. I’ve had a foot (or at least a tiptoe) in both the writing and science worlds for a while now.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What book can you not stop talking to people about?</p>
<p>MD:<em> The Poisonwood Bible</em> by Barbara Kingsolver. Old news, I know, but I finally read it this summer, and though I’ve read quite a few things by Kingsolver, this is my new favorite. I love the shift in perspectives, the lyrical prose, and the way she captures the wonder and horror of being trapped in a foreign place. We need more novels that focus on faraway places so carefully, so compassionately.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What book inspires or compels your writing?</p>
<p>MD: <em>The Blind Assassin</em> by Margaret Atwood. I’m a big Atwood junky, but this resonates with me because it’s so many things all at once: historic fiction, sci-fi, good ‘ole literary fiction. My writing is really driven by outside sources and sometimes that’s science or history or religion, but it’s hard to balance real-life fact with the fictional momentum of a piece. I’m also drawn to non-linear narratives and stories that always keep you on your toes, keep you guessing.  <em>Blind Assassin</em> does all of the above and does it in a sly, not-pretentious way. In many ways it’s been my almanac of how to write.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What (other than Flyway) literary magazines do you read?</p>
<p>MD: <em>Glimmer Train</em>, <em>The Beloit Fiction Journal</em> and <em>Ecotone</em> have been long time favorites. I also read a lot of online journals, like <em>Paper Darts</em>, <em>Diagram</em>, <em>[PANK]</em>, <em>NAP</em>, <em>Birdfeast</em>, <em>THRUSH</em>, <em>Fiddleback</em>, and <em>Brevity</em>.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</p>
<p>MD: I don’t really search for specific writers, I usually just bounce around and read whatever peaks my interest. Lately, I keep coming across stories by Lauren Groff and I’ve loved everything of hers.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Is there an aspect of the writing life, or the writing industry, that deserves more attention than it gets?</p>
<p>MD: I have these magnificent dreams of a world where poetry is as widespread as something like, let’s say, &#8220;Keeping up with the Kardashians.&#8221; Although really high quality fiction and nonfiction can make it into pop culture, I wish poetry had the spotlight more often. And really in this instant gratification, 150 character, fast paced time, you’d think poetry would be the go-to form of reading. Quick, powerful, BOOM. It blows you off your feet in a way that &#8220;Keeping up with the Kardashians&#8221; just can’t.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What advice do you have for potential-contributors of Flyway?</p>
<p>MD: We really are open to broad, strange, sideways takes on the “environment.” Although I love a good wilderness work with sweeping Steinbeck setting descriptions, I’m more intrigued by something a little different. Show us something with a little whimsy or grit. Show us an urban environment, an anti-environment, a volcanic, crepuscular, moonscape environment. Also, read some work from <em>Flyway</em> before you submit to see what we’re all about. It’s free! Also, please read our submission guidelines and label your work with the correct genre. A writer that can’t read is worrisome indeed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Rhett Trull is the editor and founder of <a href="http://www.cavewallpress.com/index.html">Cave Wall</a>, a biannual print journal out of Greensboro, North Carolina. Flyway blogger Andrew Payton got the chance to ask Ms. Trull a few questions about her work.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Payton: </strong>What is the story behind Cave Wall? How did it start? What was the driving force?</p>
<p><strong>Rhett Trull: </strong>My husband Jeff and I started <em>Cave Wall </em><em>five years ago </em>in order to celebrate poems we love. I’ve been a collector of favorite poems my whole life and for years have kept notebooks and files of them, returning to them often. Also, I love literary journals. I’ve subscribed to many over the years and always wanted to start my own. When I met Jeff, someone else who appreciates journals and poetry, the timing was right and <em>Cave Wall</em> was born. Maybe it sounds kind of cheesy, but the driving force is love. When a poem excites me I want to shout it out to the whole world; I want everyone to experience it. <em>Cave Wall </em>is a way to try to share those poems with, if not the whole world, at least an enthusiastic, appreciative group of readers.</p>
<p><strong>AP: </strong>Would you say that you have a particular aesthetic as an editor? What do you look for in a poem or poet?</p>
<p><strong>RT: </strong>Whatever my editorial aesthetic is remains somewhat of a mystery to me, and I like it that way. My tastes in poetry are ever-changing. I try to be open to all styles, as do Jeff and our other main <em>Cave Wall </em>reader, Michael Boccardo. We like poems that are long, short, lyric, narrative, funny, sad, and everything in between, as long as they move us. I guess that’s what I’m looking for when I read through a stack of submissions: I want a poem to leave me somewhere different than it finds me. I want to be changed by a poem. Also, I’m looking for a voice, one that engages my attention in a way that makes me forget everything else but this poem in this moment.</p>
<p>One interesting thing I’ve noticed as I put together these issues is how each one ends up developing its own aesthetic; certain themes emerge and are echoed. Sometimes, at the end of a reading period, when we’re trying to figure out which poem out of twenty worthy poems gets the last slot in an issue, one of the deciding factors becomes which poem fits best with the others we’ve gathered.</p>
<p><strong>AP: </strong>Your first collection of poetry, <em>The Real Warnings</em>, was published in 2009 by Anhinga Press. How does being a poet yourself inspire your work as an editor? Where do these two roles intersect?</p>
<p><strong>RT: </strong>I think the main intersection between editing and writing, at least for me, has to do with an exchange of energy. Getting to spend the majority of my time bouncing between two types of work about which I’m passionate is a luxury I try not to take for granted. If the work on one gets frustrating, I turn to the other and am refreshed, renewed. Certainly, working on <em>Cave Wall </em>has improved my writing, as does any time spent reading and studying good poetry. Plus, spending time with poetry I love makes me a happier person, fills me with gratitude, and that good energy gets carried over into all other parts of my life. As for how being a poet might inspire my work as an editor, well, it helps me appreciate how much work goes into each line, each word, of each poem. I hope this appreciation comes out in my responses to submissions. We receive many strong poems and have room to publish just a few, but I try whenever possible to respond personally to those we don’t accept, pointing out something I liked about the poems, letting the poet know that I value the time I spent with their work.</p>
<p><strong>AP: </strong>As I’ve said, I found the most recent issue of <em>Cave Wall</em> superb. As the magazine is not affiliated with a university, like many seem to be these days, how do you promote <em>Cave Wall</em>? Who are most of your readers? And do you hope to expand that base of readers?</p>
<p><strong>RT: </strong>Thank you. Your enthusiasm about issue 10 makes me happy. And this interview will, I hope, bring a few more readers our way. Word of mouth and advertisements here and there are our main method of promoting <em>Cave Wall, </em>as well as venues like <em>Poetry Daily, Verse Daily, Luna Park Review, </em>and <em>New Pages</em>. The editors of those sites are invaluable when it comes to letting readers know what’s going on in the world of small presses. It helps to win some awards recognition, too, and we’re thrilled that two poems from issue 7 were chosen by Kevin Young for the <em>Best American Poetry </em>that came out this fall.<em> </em>Our subscription numbers continue to climb each year, and yes, we want to keep that number growing. We try to expand our advertising a little every year. We go to AWP. Meanwhile, we try to keep the subscription cost low, knowing how many good journals are out there and how precious each dollar is these days.</p>
<p><strong>AP: </strong>Cave Wall publishes exclusively in print and exclusively poetry. Is there any impetus to move some material online or to work in other genres?</p>
<p><strong>RT: </strong>I love all genres, but <em>Cave Wall </em>is strictly a poetry and art journal. We like the size of it: just 72 pages each issue. And although we put a few poems from each issue online and may add some other digital supplemental features, <em>Cave Wall </em>will remain a print journal always. The simple reason is that I love books and don’t enjoy reading on a screen for long periods of time. We’re happy with <em>Cave Wall </em>just the way it is. Technology is exciting and fun to explore, but isn’t there something about print publications that ought to be celebrated and continued, too? I think so. I’m going to keep celebrating. I’m in love with books.</p>
