								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Review by Lydia Melby</span></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">“When the hail came, when the river bucked and broke its banks, when the children lay awake in the late hours fevered and coughing—they knew this place belonged to the devil, had always belonged to him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter" title="Little Wolves cover" alt="" src="http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1333581093l/13536606.jpg" width="223" height="303" /></p>
<p>Thomas Maltman’s second novel, <em>Little Wolves</em>, a 2013 Indie Next pick, has been called a literary thriller, a poetic mystery, called gothic and mythic and haunting. It is a book that defies attempts to assign it a genre, category, or explanation. It is a book that bewilders and excites, moves and mystifies.</p>
<p><em>Little Wolves</em> takes it’s title from an old Cheyenne (and other American Indian nations) term for coyotes. While this isn’t a common name for <em>Canis Latrans</em> in most rural Minnesota communities, the setting of this novel, a small town “about 200 miles west of the Twin Cities” called Lone Mountain, occupies a realm of the surreal and fantastic, where American Indian, Anglo-Saxon, and biblical mythologies wage war, and where coyotes play their little part in other “wolves’” lives. While it’s a “pretty enough town at first glance,” with “women sweeping their porches, the men cutting precise patterns on riding lawnmowers,” a town with church luncheons and lock-ins and an annual Longfellow pageant, Lone Mountain is also a place where it’s inhabitants talk frankly of the devil’s threat, where lone billboards command <em>Thou Shalt Not Kill</em> “in stark black and white” and where residents are still counted strangers twenty=five years after their move.</p>
<p><em>Little Wolves</em> opens in the hours after a troubled teenage boy methodically sawed the barrel off his new shotgun, “limped into town” and shot the town sheriff in the face before committing suicide in a cornfield. The story follows the effects this tragedy has on the boy’s father, Grizz, and Clara, an expecting mother who recently moved to Lone Mountain with her pastor husband and taught Seth’s high school English class.</p>
<p>As Grizz tries to understand how he seemingly knew so little about his son, the boy who saved and raised orphaned coyote pups, Clara tries to come to terms with her own family troubles—a barely-remembered mother, who died under mysterious circumstances, an overbearing father who mythologized her mother’s death with adjusted folklore and legends, and a distant husband preoccupied with his work and ambivalent about their coming child. And as both grope for understanding, they find instead more questions and dark hints, signs for those who would see, that Lone Mountain shelters secrets more vicious than their legends.</p>
<p>In its best moments, <em>Little Wolves</em> is remarkable, a starkly hewn northern gothic in the vein of McCarthy or O’Connor’s southern standards of the genre. Maltman’s prose, especially when describing the desolate prairie in drought or in winter or when suggesting the presence of the Other, a hovering sensation of a figure standing behind you in the dark, that ungrounding when you realize no one is who you thought.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter" title="Maltman, author" alt="" src="http://thomasmaltman.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tom-blue-shirt-filter2.jpg" width="378" height="284" /></p>
<p>In Lone Mountain, Maltman brings together several very real threats—a violent outburst, menacing authorities, stone-faced secrets, drought, modernization, even the coming winter. The story takes off with the first two jarring, gripping chapters, and as the tension piles on, the reader’s flush of adrenaline seems a natural and necessary reaction.</p>
<p>Atop this gritty realism are many layers of the supernatural—Clara’s obsession with Anglo-Saxon mythology, and her belief that both the legend of Beowulf and of her missing mother hold the key to some great mystery, collides with her husband’s (and the community’s) fear of Satan and God’s wrath and Grizz’s lifelong fixation on the Hiawatha lore. Admittedly, these elements are heavy doses taken all together, but Maltman uses these devices to sketch what his expert tone has already implied—a pervading darkness hovering over the town, seeping in at the edges of everyone’s vision but impossible to face head on.</p>
<p>With <em>Little Wolves</em>, Maltman weaves a beautiful, bewildering cloth. His plot, which begins anchored in the gritty realism he does so well, becomes slightly unmoored by its own fantasy as the many loosely knotted narrative threads twist into something vague and inscrutable. However, the characters, though often baffling in interaction and motivation, are sympathetic and genuine, while the suspense and eerie atmosphere certainly earns <em>Little Wolves</em> its loose ends and indulgences.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the considerable strength of <em>Little Wolves</em> lays in how deftly the author evokes his lovely, unsettling landscape—dropping readers into a scene, a fear, a town, a way of life. Even as the plot grows chaotic, Maltman’s prose does not falter—many passages caught my breath and brought me back to reread and savor, like the passage below, as Grizz broods over a rifle, “a cold deadweight… the farm boys in this stretch of country grew up with.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left">“They became teenagers who shot at street signs from moving cars or shot loads of buckshot straight up in the sky and then scurried for cover before the deadly lead rained down. They grew up and the guns grew with them. A .410 could take down a coon or even a small deer at close range; a 20 gauge could pluck a fleeing pheasant or goose from the blue. Shot or slug, steel or lead, they could cite velocities and tell stories of the improbably kill or the one that got away. They ate what they killed, mostly, but sometimes they killed out of boredom… kills they later regretted but could not undo.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This moment, eerily relevant today, is just one of many that echo in the reader’s skull. And that, perhaps, is the mark of a fine novel—not the number of loose threads or missing answers, but rather something that strikes deep enough that we care enough to circle these stranded questions hours, days, even weeks after we have closed the book.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philip Roth is getting a PBS documentary, George Saunders just published a new short story collection <em>Tenth of December</em>, and David Sedaris is getting a film adaptation. The established writers (and retirees) and starting off 2013 strong. But I want to hone in on new talent this week, get a glimpse at the writers that’ll be lining your bookshelves in ten years (or hopefully less!). You’ll be able to tell your friends with a hipster-esque pride that you read these writers before the book tours and accolades.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.gulfcoastmag.org/index.php?n=24" target="_blank">“Personal Statement”</a> poetry by Claire Sylvester Smith (in <em>Gulf Coast</em>). Smith is an emerging poet whose work is forthcoming in <em>Boston Review, Colorado Review, </em>and <em>Barn Owl</em>. “A darkling mechanical/sense lives within me and asks to see the ceilings of my church…”</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.gulfcoastmag.org/index.php?n=2&amp;si=49&amp;s=3096" target="_blank">An Interview with the 2012 Gulf Fiction Prize Winner, Geetha Iyer</a> (in <em>Gulf Coast</em>)<br />
While we’re on <em>Gulf Coast</em>, I can’t help notice the interview with the winner of the 2012 Gulf Fiction Prize. Did I mention that winner is Iowa State University’s own Geetha Iyer? Read along to hear Iyer discuss her short story “The Glass World Builder” with Gulf Coast Senior Editorial Assistant Kim Vera.</p>
<p><a href="http://brevitymag.com/current-issue/the-first-time-i-had-sex/" target="_blank">“The First Time I Had Sex, My Mouth Was Numb”</a> nonfiction by Kyra Anderson (in <em>Brevity</em>).<br />
Anderson teaches us the power of attention grabbing titles with her short non-fiction piece. The piece is an endearing account of losing her virginity after visiting the dentist’s office. Her work has appeared in <em>Tiny Lights</em> and <em>Flash Fiction</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bodegamag.com/articles/15-pamachapuka" target="_blank">&#8220;Pamachapuka,&#8221;</a> fiction by Jon Steinhagen (in <em>Bodega</em>)<br />
Steinhagen refers to himself as a playwright first, but his story in the excellent new online magazine <em>Bodega</em> is a short, funny piece about moving the unmovable. When a giant glacial boulder begins to move, it and its history take a toll in two interwoven narratives.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the talented men and women carving out their place in the arena of letters. Hopefully we’ll be seeing much more from each of them in the future. Continue reading Flyway blog for more fledgling talent and established hard hitters. See you next week!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Michelle Donahue</em></p>
<p>January marks the time when weather starts getting cold. <em>Really </em>cold. In most parts of the country there is always snow in January and even if there isn’t, chill has settled in and big, bulky coats become an every day staple. Certainly, no one shows much skin in January. And so, the inner Californian and heat-lover in me, thinks it’s important in these cold times to remember warm, bare-skin weather.</p>
<p>So in this week’s web-rove, I bring you three short pieces, one from each genre, that feature skin, specifically women’s skin.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pankmagazine.com/my-birthday-suit/">“My Birthday Suit”</a> poetry by Mia Sara (on <em>PANK)<br />
</em>This inventive poem on growing old inverts the ideas of clothing and nakedness. I admire the brutality and sadness and I love how the narrator describes that she is turning inside out.</p>
<p><a href="http://thefiddleback.com/issue-items/this-land-is-my-land">“This Land is My Land”</a> fiction by Samuel Ligon (on <em>The Fiddleback)<br />
</em>This short piece packs a powerful punch. Though skin certainly isn’t a main focus of this, a girl “with the skin condition” becomes one of many people who cannot be happy in the narrator’s imagined “intellectual property”. This work is about the illusion of happiness and the illusions inherent in all of our lives.</p>
<p><a href="http://brevitymag.com/current-issue/in-our-skin/">“In Our Skin”</a> nonfiction by Diana Cage (on <em>Brevity</em>)<br />
The prose here sings. This beautiful essay touches on skin and heat and love. The beauty of two women, hot and laid out on a quilt juxtaposes wonderfully to more serious ramifications of heat—burnings, deaths by dehydration and more.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We here at Flyway wish everyone a Happy New Year! Take a break from the festivities to check out our latest Web Rove for this season.</p>
<p><a href="http://monkeybicycle.net/dirty-birds/">“Dirty Birds”</a> by Blaze Kinzey (from <em>Monkeybicycle)<br />
</em>This piece of flash fiction jumps right into its story, just as the genre requires, and we learn that the sad reality that this story can be told over and again. Though we don’t really get a clear sense of what’s at stake for these two brothers, we feel like we do, and it doesn’t feel too good.</p>
<p><a href="http://english.wisc.edu/devilslake/issues/spring2012/Lawless.html"> “Factoryville Eclogue”</a> by Gregory Lawless (from <em>Devil’s Lake</em>)<br />
I love the terse language of this poem, and really admire the last image of the spilled lumber truck, freezing over and circled by ravens.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.versedaily.org/2012/onomens.shtml"> “On Omens”</a> by Mark Wunderlich (from <em>Verse Daily</em>)<br />
This has that really simple but descriptive language that really leaps to different meaning because of the more abstract in the poem. Somehow the simple image of two coyotes crossing the yard hits so well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.decompmagazine.com/huntergatherer.htm">“hunter gatherer”</a> by kelly schirmann (from <em>decomP</em>)<br />
This poem succeeds where I see a lot of other poems failing; it blends the clear narrative story with striking imagery and abstract ideas.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/172201"> “Advent”</a> by Mary Jo Salter (from <em>Poetry</em>)<br />
And a Christmas poem!</p>

It&#8217;s a week since Thanksgiving and you still feel full; well, how about emptying yourself by choosing to walk places within a 2-mile range? This writer took the time and effort. She considered going the distance an opportunity rather than a challenge.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just last Sunday, we hosted our annual Flyway Benefit Auction to great success. Thank you to everyone who donated something by participating in one of the events we featured Sunday night. For those friends of Flyway who couldn&#8217;t be there in person, thank you for always being there in spirit. We are about to undergo some big changes, so your support mean all the more to us at this time!</p>
<p>To celebrate the post-benefit/ post-election, here are a few creative selections from around the web in this week&#8217;s web rove:</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/mean/arthur-krystal-and-everyones-favorite-genre-fiction-fallacy/">Arthur Krystal and Everyone&#8217;s Favorite Genre Fiction Fallacy</a>&#8220;<em> </em>by Mike Meginnis (from <em>HTML Giant</em>)<br />
Mike bends and blurs genre; such as his recent &#8220;Navigators&#8221; originally published in <em>Hobart</em> and then included in the <em>Best American Short Stories 2013</em>. He also defends and defines genre as way to compel plot, while also still being a good story. Have a read and then weigh in on the conversation in the comments section.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/343316/the-artist-and-the-critic-8-famous-authoreditor-relationships">The Artist and the Critic</a>&#8221; by Emily Temple (from <em>Flavorwire)</em><br />
Last fall I read the tome <em>Max Perkins: Editor of Genius</em> by biographer A. Scott Berg, which includes the Scribner editor&#8217;s trying relationships with a trifecta of the famous authors F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe. This list of eight editing relationships starts with Perkins and Wolfe, but includes seven other pairings. Throughout them all consider how an editor is a super-reader for a writer.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.worldhum.com/features/travel-stories/why-we-travel-20081213/">Why We Travel</a>&#8221; by Pico Iyer (from <em>WorldHum</em>)<br />
This is a manifesto from a transnational who has witnessed the world by participating in it via travel. Iyer shows both directions of leaving and returning: what we take there and what we bring back. Go on an imaginative trip just by reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/oct/24/simon-garfield-top-10-maps">Top 10 Books with Maps</a>&#8221; by Simon Garfield (from <em>the Guardian</em>)<br />
As cliche as it sounds for this to be a starting point on a journey of maps, this list offers just that. These books include maps on the author&#8217;s radar. Of course, there&#8217;s more than just these ten, so why not add to the list your own favorite maps in books?</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/443/please_dont_vote_for_me">Please Don&#8217;t Vote for Me</a>&#8221; by Sparrow (from <em>the Sun</em>)<br />
As the editors note: &#8220;The poet and political provocateur Sparrow has run for U.S. president in every election since 1992. Sometimes he runs as a Republican and other times as a member of a party of his own invention — the Pajama Party, the Ear of Corn Party, the Sudoku for All Party. To his knowledge he has never received any votes, but this seems only to encourage him.&#8221; Find out why Sparrow even runs, what his &#8220;issues&#8221; are, and how he never gets any votes in this tongue-in-cheek piece.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>by Michelle Donahue</h6>
<p>An anthropologist travels to the Chalbi desert in Kenya to study the nomadic, <em>Dasse</em> people. While there, Abudo befriends the anthropologist and teaches him the names of things. He points outs objects, one at a time, and says their names, teaching the anthropologist the language, the way of thinking of the <em>Dasse</em>. Abudo teaches the anthropologist just as John Colman Wood teaches the reader in his first novel, <em>The Names of Things</em>. Wood teaches us about the <em>Dasse</em>, about their daily life and their burial practices and about the anthropologist who begins to question everything after his wife falls ill. Wood teaches us one word at a time, in short, poignant scenes, until slowly we begin to learn.</p>
<div style="width: 282px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Map of Kenya with the Chalbi desert shown by the square" alt="" src="http://savingstripes.wildlifedirect.org/files/2010/02/Kenya_map.jpg" width="272" height="330" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Map of Kenya with the Chalbi desert shown by the square</p></div>
<p>The work opens with the anthropologist observing his wife, an artist, in her studio. She invites him because she liked having a witness. But he tells us this is his interpretation only, immediately keying the reader into the problems of being an observer. Our journey starts with his wife’s artwork, a piece of moving light mixed with incredible dark. From here, Wood takes us on a journey through space and time.</p>
<p>There is the present, when the anthropologist has returned to the desert, years after his initial stay. He returns with no real reason except to try to find answers, to try to feel home again among the <em>Dasse.</em> There is the past, when he first came to know the <em>Dasse</em> and became friends with Abudo. He learns their language, speaks in strange phrases like “Do the children smell good?”. As he learns the sayings and mannerism of the <em>Dasse</em> so do we.  His wife doesn’t like life in the desert and moves to Maikona, the closest city.</p>
<p>Then there is the time before and after his first trip. Before: a time of love and newness with his wife. With deft and surprising prose, Wood begins their relationship. Then there is after: a time when his wife falls ill, a strange illness that makes her weaker and weaker. And throughout all this, Wood provides sections that read like excerpts from ethnographies that describe the ceremonies the <em>Dasse</em> perform.</p>
<p>Through these pieces, Wood reveals not only a compelling story, but explores the meaning of truth, commitment and love. The anthropologist questions his identity and wonders if the true problem with anthropology is not that the observer has an effect on the observed, but that the observer cannot let go of him or herself. When the anthropologist unearths a possible lie from his wife and has no way to deny or confirm it, he seeks to find a way to let go of himself.</p>
<div style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="John Coleman Wood" alt="Author, John Coleman Wood" src="http://www.ashlandcreekpress.com/authors/images/john_wood_250.jpg" width="250" height="224" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Author, John Coleman Wood</p></div>
<p>I keep running into people and feeling that I must recommend <em>The Names of Things</em> to them. You like exquisite and sad love stories? Read this. You like books with a bit of mystery to them? You’re fascinated with burial/marriage/birthing practices of other cultures? You want fiction? Nonfiction? Ethnography? Read this. This novel gives everything you would want and more. Wood gives us a peak of <em>Dasse</em> life with the detail oriented mind and cultural sensitivity of an anthropologist. He gives us the love, sadness and riveting plot of a gifted writer. I had been looking for a book I couldn’t put down and in <em>The Names of Things</em> I found one.</p>

<p>“<a href="http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v5n2/poetry/levis_l/grass.htm" target="_blank">Some Grass along a Ditch Bank</a>” by Larry Levis (from Blackbird)<br />
A poem about grass by a great poet.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://anti-poetry.com/johnsonam2/" target="_blank">It’s the Kingfish, Honey—Pining</a>” by Amaud Jamaul Johnson (from Anti-)<br />
I’m not exactly sure what’s going on or how Johnson makes this short poem happen, but it’s got great voice and a wonderful ending.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.fifthwednesdayjournal.com/selections/poetry.shtml" target="_blank">Pit Ponies</a>” by Theodosia Henney (from Fifth Wednesday)<br />
I like poems where I learn things that I didn’t expect to learn about. Ponies in mines. Hmm.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v5n2/poetry/black_r/tolberton.htm" target="_blank">Tolberton County, 1923</a>” by Rebecca Black (from Blackbird)<br />
This is just a mighty fine poem.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.tingemagazine.org/i-looked-for-you-i-called-your-name/" target="_blank">I Looked for You, I Called Your Name</a>” by Laura van den Berg (from Ploughshares, republished in<br />
TINGE)<br />
I’d been wanting to read a story by this author for some time, and this is the one I stumbled on. I know it’s already got a bit of attention, but I enjoyed it and so should you.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Fiction editor Lydia Melby reviews the latest collection by one of her favorite authors.</em></p>
<p>&#8211; * &#8211;</p>
<p>October is a time for stories about the uncanny, the unexpected, and the feared. The cooling air and paling daylight brings a sense of a thinning barrier, an atmosphere ripe for the appearance of signs to decode. And in his newest collection of short stories, <em>Stay Awake</em>, Dan Chaon gives us these stories, increasing the atmospheric pressure with each sentence, each blank section break, and we grow more and more uneasy as we read, and cannot stop.</p>
<p>In <em>Stay Awake, </em>children wake up   screaming. Parents fall asleep at the wheel. Men wake up choking, some with notes they aren’t sure they wrote, and can’t quite understand. Parents lean over their children in the dark, watching them sleep, reaching for them. Three girls sleep through their own attempted murder, and some day in the future, a girl will wake up with the memory of the presence of another inside her own mind, a voice that whispers “<em>I’m still awake.” </em>And she will wonder what it means, like the author writing, like us who read, they all wonder what it means.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to understand.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780345530370-0" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px none; margin: 2px 10px;" src="http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20120217-stay-awake.jpg.ece/BINARY/w620x413/STAY+AWAKE.jpg" alt="" width="191" height="289" /></a><br />
In “I Wake Up,” Rob describes his disorientation as “that sense of grasping, a foot coming down and not finding the ground.” It’s a sense we feel more and more as each story progresses, even worse because at first, we <em>can</em> find the ground, or so we think, as each story grows out of a heavy realism. These people are the sort of characters we expect from Chaon—the drifting, the tired, the quiet members of society who creep along in its outer edges. People who live in the wide, blank loneliness of the Midwest, who bag groceries or drive semis. These are characters who’ve all lost someone, often in ways we consciously dread, or have even seen.</p>
<p>Like the father in the title story, everyone is looking for some sort of answer. After a long struggle to conceive, Zach’s baby Rosalie is born with   two heads  joined at the crown, mirror-image faces, a “parasitic  twin” incapable of life without Rosalie’s body. <em>Why do people want to have babies? </em>Zach and his wife wonder, and as the answer approaches us, Chaon disconnects the narrative in a way that we read the whole story again, dreading that hint we’re sure we missed the first time around.</p>
<p>These stories, each told in the simple, melancholy prose we’ve come to love about Chaon’s work, mine that richness of possibility, that foreboding, not revealing what is waiting in the dark or on the other side of the door, looking at us through the window, but not fully in view. The best of these will cause a visceral reaction, a choking   feeling in your throat, something growing  in the back of your skull, “a flicker of consciousness would wink on and off.”</p>
<p>And as the answer approaches like in “Slowly We Open Our Eyes,” as “that awful, inevitable feeling…the ticking of a roulette wheel as the marble finally settles in place, ” Chaon cuts us off with our own, “Oh my God.”</p>
<p>This is not to say these stories leave us hanging. Many are well-written but predictable—<em>“</em>St. Dismas,” “The Bees,” “Long Expected, Always Delayed,” “Thinking of You in Your Time of Sorrow.”</p>
<p>Others give us answers that are there, eerily within our reach.</p>
<p>When Critter in <em>To Psychic Underworld:</em> loses his wife, he begins to find little notes—stickies in the library about cybersex, a frantic love letter on a dollar bill, a single, plaintive word on every napkin in a clean stack. The messages grow more pointed, more private, until the last is spoken directly into his mind as he nears an inevitable breaking point that we don’t see, but expect.</p>
<p>And his survival is a stronger possibility than perhaps the saddest of these characters— Brandon in <em>Patrick Lane, Flabbergasted</em>, a young man living alone in the same house his parents killed themselves in. His world is slowly shrinking, his living space confining itself to the humming fort of the electronics that circle his bed, shrinking just as irrevocably as the window for his escape. The end to this story is as final and definite as we don’t want it to be.</p>
<p>But it’s the final story, “The Farm. The Gold. The Lily White Hands.” that most evokes a sense of otherworldly, a feeling as if a person you were speaking to stared at something over your shoulder, and then   jumped. It’s the story I’ve read again and again, read aloud to myself and to unfortunate friends. It’s Chaon’s most experimental to date, and it’s the kind of story that will only exist once, a flawless sustained gasp. Chaon slowly, quietly, fills us first with sadness, then with dread, poured like a stream of cold, wet sand, bringing us the dreams we never wanted to admit we’d had, had and savored, and   remembered the next  morning  whenever it was we   woke up.</p>
<p>Because we do understand each other. We do understand.</p>
<p>And perhaps that’s why we jump, even though it’s the most commonplace thing in the world, when the wife waiting at our bedside looks up surprised, or the mother leaning over us in the dark touches our shoulder.</p>
<p><em>Oh</em>, she says. <em>You’re   awake</em></p>
<p>&#8211; * &#8211;</p>
