								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SEPTEMBER 2014: NEW CONTENT!</p>
<p>Whether you’re kicking off a new academic year, wriggling under the weight of the dog days, or enthusiastically imbibing the heat of summer before it turns into fall, you want to make some room in your schedule for <i>Flyway’s</i> September, 2014, publication cycle.</p>
<p>To put your mind in an artistic mood, you may want to start by investigating our new visuals: evocative macro-photographs by Carolyn Guinzio.</p>
<p>Then head to our non-fiction sector — delight yourself with local food, fiddleheads, and fireflies. Allegra Hyde shares her experience preparing a locally-sourced meal on a Bahamian island in “Coming to the Table”; in “Eating Pieces of the Universe,” Pamela Baker remembers her youth in Maine, foraging for fiddleheads with her father, while she copes with her father’s new-found cancer; and Megan Ewald connects a familial disaster with her passion for the natural world and the magic of fireflies in her essay “Finding Luminescence.”</p>
<p>Our two new pieces of fiction this month visit the dark side, and you won’t be able to stop reading them. In Alisha Karabinus’s ”When Henry Sayles Ate a Bullet,” explore the depression and suicide of a police officer who’s downfall is deeply intertwined with the decline of his small Illinois town. And witness a wrenching freeway accident with the disgruntled narrator of Caleb Stone’s story “Tough World for Tigers.”</p>
<p>Last but never least, we’re featuring three new poems this month that are sure to bewitch you. “Surfeit” by Katherine L. Hester and “A Good Death” by Anne Haven McDonnell capture and reconstitute the pulsing season of summer in two extraordinarily unique, visceral ways. On a different track, fast-paced narrative poem “To the Man Who Ordered the Pad Kee Mow,” by Doc Suds, will have you looking at your ethnic food differently for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Enjoy this work, and thank you for reading, everyone!</p>
