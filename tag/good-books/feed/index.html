								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Nick Bogdanich<br />
</em><br />
As a fan of the post apocalyptic genre, I appreciated Peter Heller’s knowledge of the canon.  His novel <em>The Dog Stars </em>features allusions to everything from <em>Mad Max</em> to Cormac McCarthy’s <em>The Road</em>, to the television show <em>Life After People</em>.  Where many post apocalyptic narratives seem to dispense with all but the most abstract references to some barely relevant past, Heller’s landscape is more firmly rooted in the detritus of civilization.  In this way, <em>The Dog Stars</em> justifies itself among other examples of the genre by begging the question: what draws us to it?  Why do we relish imagining ourselves in scenarios where society has fractured and our only function is survival?</p>
<p>The novel’s protagonist Hig is having trouble adapting to the apocalypse, although, despite the loss, loneliness, and killing, things are actually looking up for him.  His compound is well fortified and well stocked.  He spends his days fishing in the woods with his dog and going on Coca-Cola runs in his small plane to an overturned delivery truck.  For Hig’s gun enthusiast survival partner Bangley, the apocalypse has uncovered his true calling: guarding the perimeter of the compound.  He scoffs at Hig for taking too much recreational pleasure in fishing trips, which Bangley considers risky and lacking sufficient return in resources.</p>
<p>The relationship between these two characters is one of this novel’s most compelling devices.  Hig struggles to maintain the status quo with his psychopathic partner, who seems to prefer the safety of solitude to accommodating Hig’s impetuous questing for both, minor luxuries, and a greater significance to life than mere survival.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Bangley] didn’t do anything that wasn’t aimed at surviving…Sometimes I think the only reason he kept me around was so he had someone to witness his prowess in the winning of each day…to let me know that it was him.  That he vouchsafed our survival…”</p></blockquote>
<p>Heller entices the reader with this Eden that Bangley provides through a sniper’s scope, truncating pastoral, taxonomy laden descriptions of the Colorado plains with jarring instances of trespassers gunned down indiscriminately and turned to jerky for the dog.  In these scenes, the pared down, halting syntax obfuscates only occasionally and permits a close, unrefined perspective on the mounting tensions that lead Hig to consider leaving this safe haven which most post apocalyptic characters set out in search of.</p>
<p>Since the relationship between Hig and Bangley is more complex and unique than the love interest that fills its place in the second half of the novel, I wish Hig could have taken Bangley with him.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">If I thought I could defend this place by myself I would shoot Bangley where he stands and get it over with.  Would I?  Maybe.  And then I would miss this sparring every day…we really have become like a married couple.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>We can’t help but be disappointed when Heller trades this weird tension for the trivial awkwardness that precedes Hig’s romance, which seems like a foregone conclusion from his first encounter with the love object Cima.  Heller also attempts to fill Bangley’s void with the character of Pops, who by Hig’s own description is a lot like Bangley, and feels rehashed to the reader.</p>
<p>Where Heller really shines is in his elegiac descriptions of the rivers along which Hig fishes.  It’s a testament to Heller’s command of language and detail that he can make us grieve and root for the environment itself amidst all the human strife that takes place within it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I heard a canyon wren, the six seven eight paced notes whistling down a scale never used by man. I…saw the dipping flight of the kingfisher I’d seen almost every morning.  Moving fast up the stream.  The bigger rivers like the Gunnison weren’t drying up.  Not yet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hig takes refuge in these strongholds.  The ugliness that society embodies in its present form drives him to them, and makes him appreciate their potential for regeneration all the more. *</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last, meet <em>Flyway&#8217;s </em>creative director/ web czaress, <strong>Lindsay D&#8217;Andrea</strong>. You can find her updating the blog, tweeting, managing our Facebook page, and helping layout issue design. Consider her a behind-the-scenes editor.</p>
<div id="attachment_830" style="width: 376px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/newhair1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-830" class=" wp-image-830     " title="Lindsay D'Andrea" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/newhair1.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="302" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-830" class="wp-caption-text">Lindsay, with her most creative hair</p></div>
<p><strong><br />
What book can you not stop talking to people about?<br />
</strong>Ever since we circulated Anthony Doerr&#8217;s books around before last year&#8217;s <em>Wildness Symposium</em>, it&#8217;s been his collection of short stories, <em>The Shell Collector</em>. I just can&#8217;t get over how textured, heart-rending, complex, and epic Doerr stories are, and I recommend them to everyone. If you haven&#8217;t read it yet, that needs to be the first thing on your list. Starting now.</p>
<p><strong><br />
What book compels your writing?</strong><em></em><br />
I&#8217;ve read a lot of books on craft &#8212; too many, I think. Obviously <em>The Art of Fiction</em> is a staple. More than reading, though, I learn most from my professors and peers and the invaluable advice they give. Actually, from a different perspective, I feel most compelled to write by reading poetry<strong>, </strong>and my go-to (for now) has been  Stephen Dunn.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?<br />
I jump all over the place, sampling from a bunch of different online and print journals. I really like <em>Hayden&#8217;s Ferry</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, <em>Ecotone</em> (hurray for environmentally-minded journals!),<em> Necessary Fiction, the Rumpus, Orion, The Southern Review, AQR</em> &#8212; plus a lot more. I also love the visual art featured on <em>Escape into Life</em> and <em>Society 6</em>.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?<br />
Oh, gosh. I usually look for writers that have been on my &#8220;must-read-more&#8221; list like Karen Russell, Lauren Groff and Meghan Mayhew Bergman, but usually I read journals for the unknowns (like myself). I will just pick stories and poems at random and read them, with hope that someone out there is doing the same for me. I usually then try to follow those emerging writers on Twitter. Our technological internet-driven age means that reading shouldn&#8217;t be passive anymore&#8230;our capacity for communication is too great to ignore.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?<br />
Send us your best! A lot of times I feel like we get stories that have not been polished or edited properly or extensively. We have pretty high standards, here, and we always want the best you can give. For visual art, I look for interesting composition (in photographs) or complex relationships between visual elements. Obviously, we &#8220;like&#8221; plants and rocks and fields and pastorals, but that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re really about&#8230;surprise us with your new ideas about the environment&#8230;it&#8217;s changing at a rate that can no longer sustain a boxed-in definition.<strong></strong></p>

<div id="attachment_826" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ltigue3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-826" class="size-full wp-image-826" title="Lindsay Tigue, non-fiction editor" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ltigue3.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="338" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-826" class="wp-caption-text">Lindsay Tigue, non-fiction editor</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><br />
I already reviewed this on this blog over the summer, but <em>The Field Guide to Getting Lost </em>by Rebecca Solnit. I am <em>still</em> talking about it. It&#8217;s the kind of book where as soon as I put it down I needed to pick up another by the same author. More Solnit. I love her blend of historical and personal; the balance she achieves seems to me more fluid than a lot of nonfiction I come across.</p>
<p>As far as poetry, I cannot stop talking about <em>Words for Empty and Words for Full</em> by Bob Hicok. Not to sound hyperbolic, but I feel differently about words after reading these poems, particularly the ones about the Virginia Tech shootings. He seems to get away with so much with so little. I love that.</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><em><br />
Boys of My Youth</em> by Jo Ann Beard, <em>The Collected Stories</em> by Amy Hempel, A<em>t the Drive-In Volcano</em> by Aimee <em>Nezhukumatathil</em>, <em>Among the Missing</em> by Dan Chaon. Depending on what genre I am trying to write, these are the books I need to read and reread. Without fail, they make me want to try again. They all achieve something I really want to do.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I love <em>Third Coast</em>, <em>Ecotone</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, <em>Ninth Letter</em>, <em>Colorado Review</em>, <em>Black Warrior Review</em>, <em>Indiana Review</em>, <em>Sycamore Review</em>, <em>One Story</em>, and oh so many others.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t necessarily read literary magazines because I recognize a name. The fun is in the discovery—the heartrending essay, story, or poem by someone whom I&#8217;ve perhaps never run across before. That being said, I get excited when I see a literary magazine has a story by L. Annette Binder. I was first introduced to her work through literary magazines and I can&#8217;t wait to read her first collection, <em>Rise</em>, which was just published by Sarabande.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
At <em>Flyway</em>, our aesthetic centers around place and the environment and the essays that stand out to me are ones interpreting a confrontation or interaction with place in a surprising way. I also like essays that feel well-structured, but not contrived. I like essays where characters (including the narrator) emerge, essays where the characters become as important as the idea. There should also be some force driving the momentum of the piece, whether it&#8217;s suspense or some overarching desire or motivation that gets me to read on. I also hate to see disparaged “quiet essays,” or “quiet poems,” or “quiet stories,” as if words must to be loud to matter. I love calm human drama. I love tension. The subtle essay that doesn&#8217;t shout can often accumulate shocking power. And, really, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for; I want to be moved and surprised. Break my heart, contributors!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><br />
Often the last book I read compels my writing, and when I feel stalled and uninspired I might return to something by some of my favorites: Wendell Berry, William Stafford, Seamus Heaney, Mary Oliver, Galway Kinnell, Pablo Neruda, Salvatore Quasimodo, Sharon Olds, Louise Gluck, and Yusef Komunyakaa. This list probably keeps going.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than Flyway) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I’ll typically read whatever falls into my hand or strikes my momentary interest. But a few magazines I return to, subscribe to, or prefer: Cave <em>Wall</em>, <em>Appalachian Heritage</em>, <em>Whitefish Review</em>, <em>One Story</em>, <em>Ecotone</em>, <em>The Sun</em>, <em>The Paris Review</em>, and <em>Poetry</em>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
They may all be super famous already, but these names would definitely pique my interest in a journal: Track K Smith, Bob Hicok, Sandra Beasley, Aimee Nezhukumatathil, D.A. Powell, Maurice Manning, Frank X Walker, Linda Pastan, Natasha Trethewey, or Geoffrey Brock.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of Flyway?</strong><br />
Read books. Read magazines. Read <em>Flyway</em>! Write and submit and plant trees.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What makes our new editorial staff at <em>Flyway</em> tick? What kind of writing gets their hearts pumping and gets them reading after a hard day, week, month, or year in Iowa State University&#8217;s MFA program? Over the next month, you can find out as we introduce each of our new editors.</p>
<p>Up first: <strong>Managing Editor, Chris Wiewiora</strong></p>
<div style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://chriswiewiora.com"><img title="CHRIS WIEWIORA author photo by Ashley Inguanta" src="http://chriswiewiora.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/CHRIS-WIEWIORA-new-author-photo-by-Ashley-Inguanta-for-website-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chris &quot;Vive&quot; Wiewiora</p></div>
<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><em><br />
Fire Season: Notes from a Wilderness Lookout </em>by Philip Connors</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?<em><br />
</em></strong><em>The Writing Life</em><em> </em>by Annie Dillard</p>
<p><strong>What (other than Flyway) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I read a whole helluva lot of them…but I subscribe to <em>River Styx, the Florida Review </em>(of course)<em>, Poetry, The Sun, Cave Wall</em>, and I’m probably forgetting others. Also, online I read a lot of community writing like <em>theRumpus, Hobart, the Millions, PANK, HTML Giant, </em>et al.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
I love to find any piece by Ira Sukrungruang. I like Ben [Percy’s] modern folktales. Billy Collins seems to be in any and all lit mags. Alex Lemon’s poems are solid. Brian Doyle’s prose-poem/auto-fiction/close-to-the-heart-nonfiction. Steve Almond’s love/sex/breakup-stories. Jeffrey Brown’s memoir-and/or-satirical comics. &#8230;Megan Mayhew Berman and her animal stories. Caitlin Horrocks; though, she’s mostly in “the slicks” now. Anything by these two amazing Florida gals: Karen Russell and Laura Van den Berg. Lindsay Hunter’s wild and weird stories!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
Address your cover letters to the appropriate editor. Seriously.</p>
