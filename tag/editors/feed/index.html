								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Place, image, rhythm, and balance are all integral to poetry. And when it comes to poetry, William Bonfiglio, one of <i>Flyway</i>’s two-prong poetry editorial team, brings a sharp eye and musicality to the table. A trained opera singer, accomplished dramatist and poet, William sat down with me for an interview last week to talk about his reading sensibility and his role as a poetry editor for <i>Flyway</i></p>
<p>“What I look for in poetry is a strong setting filled with lovely details. What we [Samantha Futhey, <i>Flyway</i>’s second poetry editor] look for is a complete piece, a story that is dependent on place, where place is a character — it should be treated as a fully-developed character. We pride ourselves on the poetry we publish, that it’s complete and polished for publication.”</p>
<p>Before entering Iowa State University, William earned his undergraduate degree at Bucknell University, where he studied with writers Paula Closson Buck and Shara McCallum.</p>
<p>“It was incredibly intimidating to be in that setting,” he said.</p>
<p>After Bucknell, William spent a gap year working the late shift at a supermarket. It’s this time that William says was his most productive writing period: he’d wake each morning and write before heading into his 2 to 9 p.m. shift. During this time William also traveled to Nova Scotia, read numerous poets and prose writers, and spent time in reflection, which solidified his conviction to pursue writing, eventually leading to his enrollment in Iowa State University’s Creative Writing and Environment program.</p>
<p>When asked about his views on environment in writing, William remarks, “When you volunteer for a journal of writing and environment, the stigma is that “environment” has to be some profound or progressive idea, when in fact, environment can be interpreted as simply as the idea of place, and the role that setting plays within inspiring stories and poetry and works of creative nonfiction. Personally, my writing has always been influenced by the place where I grew up, which spans everything from the East Coast to the home in which my parents raised me.”</p>
<p>Both Futhey and William are excited about upcoming content for <i>Flyway</i>. William describes many of the submissions to the magazine as “gifts” and says that it feels good to share these authors with the wider reading world.</p>
<p>So why serve as poetry editor? William remarks that so many writers have low self-esteem and little confidence &mdash; and that reading new material for <i>Flyway,</i> and the ability to see a wide scope of great writers, has made him more confident in his own writing.</p>
<p>“As a writer, I’m reading to better myself, to see other approaches by other writers,” he says.<i> </i>“I often ask myself what makes something memorable. I’m after that in my own writing and the writing we publish at <i>Flyway</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Flyway</i>: In a couple of sentences, share something about your background—writing related or not.</p>
<p>CK: I created and operated a yellow milk-crate library as a kid. I taped makeshift Dewey-decimal-system identifiers to the spines of my books and &#8220;loaned&#8221; them out to my sister and parents, and—if I recall correctly—attempted to institute fines. It didn&#8217;t last, but I still LOVE libraries!</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What book can you not stop talking to people about?</p>
<p>CK: Year in and year out, since reading William Gibson&#8217;s <i>Neuromancer</i>, it&#8217;s always wiggling its way into discussions (mostly in my head, but—yes—also with others) about the intersections between psychology, technology, communication, and architecture in the future. So, basically, any chance to make it relevant, I take!</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What book inspires or compels your writing?</p>
<p>CK: The more I write, the more I realize how inescapable the experiences and ingrained aesthetics of childhood really are. A book that changed how I viewed words—and what I wanted to get out of their arrangement in books—is <i>The Crown Snatchers</i>, by F. K. Waechter and Bernd Ellert. At the time it was, for me, innovatively subversive, challenging, and rewarding—a combination of story and illustrations that were questions themselves. Though I&#8217;m not exactly creating graphic poetry, I try to channel that feeling by writing in a way that lets people figure something out about their own minds, their own emotions, their own inner workings. A more genre-relevant, current writer I&#8217;m really enjoying is Rita Dove&#8230; about a poem a day hits the spot and inspires.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What literary magazines (other than <i>Flyway</i>) do you read?</p>
<p>CK: Thanks to social media, I like skipping around via friend-recommended poems and then digging into the parent magazine. Regular reads include <i>Rattle</i>, <i>Ecotone</i>, <i>Black Warrior Review</i>, <i>Gulf Coast</i>, and <i>Diagram</i>. <i>Wag&#8217;s Revue</i> has featured some refreshing art.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</p>
<p>CK: I don&#8217;t feel I can properly answer this question with specific names—both because it changes all the time, and because I&#8217;m a connectionist, always seeking novel variations on the same good words and ideas; names I recognize and respect guide me into magazines which are publishing relatively new voices that are likely to offer similar quality, resonance, voice, or value.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: Is there an aspect of the writing life, or the writing industry, that deserves more attention than it gets?</p>
<p>CK: Book cover design does so much work to make or break a book, in my opinion. It&#8217;s so much more than a graphic art—the psychology behind a successful designer encompasses an intimate understanding of everything from industry trends to the season&#8217;s &#8220;fashionable colors.&#8221; There&#8217;s definitely rising interest in, and appreciation for, this art—and maybe it&#8217;ll be a way to preserve the physicality of books even when the pages are in some electronic tablet. Maybe we&#8217;ll wear their visual representations on our walls as art? Check out the LA Times&#8217; &#8220;<a title="Best Book Covers of the Year" href="http://www.latimes.com/features/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-the-best-book-covers-of-the-year-selected-by-designers-20130626,0,1404191.photogallery" target="_blank">Best Book Covers of the Year.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What advice do you have for potential-contributors of Flyway?</p>
<p>CK: I want to be surprised; I want to be delighted. I want to wake up thinking about how the parallels you drew—the metaphors you implied—were as obvious, as genius, as concrete, but so completely original that jealousy and reverence are the only possible reactions. Do the work to incite an epiphany between my own neurons, tricking me to thinking it was my own—and leave me with a sweet but intrigued taste in my mouth. But most of all, I want your words to plant an understanding of how it feels to love the world like you do.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: What extinct animal do you wish could be revived, &amp; why?</p>
<p>CK: Probably the pterodactyl (but only temporarily, for ethical don&#8217;t-mess-with-time-travel-and-evolutionary-order reasons). I&#8217;d wonder if other birds would freak out or somehow respond to it. And: if you cut it, would it bleed&#8230; warm or cold? (<a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news63081.html" target="_blank">2013 University of Adelaide research</a> indicates: warm).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this first of an ongoing series &#8220;Meet your <em>Flyway</em> Editors,&#8221; our new Managing Editor Michelle Donahue talks about talking about books, &#8220;Keeping up with the Kardashians,&#8221; and why she&#8217;s so excited for this new publication year.</p>
<div id="attachment_2192" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/michelle-donahue-180.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192" class="size-full wp-image-2192" alt="Michelle Donahue, Managing Editor" src="http://flyway.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/michelle-donahue-180.jpg" width="180" height="180" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2192" class="wp-caption-text">Michelle Donahue, Managing Editor</p></div>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: In a couple of sentences, share something about your background &#8211; writing related or not.</p>
<p>MD: I’ve got a background in science. I have a bachelors in environmental biology, have taken ecology classes in three countries, and did some National Park volunteer work in the Galapagos. I’ve had a foot (or at least a tiptoe) in both the writing and science worlds for a while now.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What book can you not stop talking to people about?</p>
<p>MD:<em> The Poisonwood Bible</em> by Barbara Kingsolver. Old news, I know, but I finally read it this summer, and though I’ve read quite a few things by Kingsolver, this is my new favorite. I love the shift in perspectives, the lyrical prose, and the way she captures the wonder and horror of being trapped in a foreign place. We need more novels that focus on faraway places so carefully, so compassionately.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What book inspires or compels your writing?</p>
<p>MD: <em>The Blind Assassin</em> by Margaret Atwood. I’m a big Atwood junky, but this resonates with me because it’s so many things all at once: historic fiction, sci-fi, good ‘ole literary fiction. My writing is really driven by outside sources and sometimes that’s science or history or religion, but it’s hard to balance real-life fact with the fictional momentum of a piece. I’m also drawn to non-linear narratives and stories that always keep you on your toes, keep you guessing.  <em>Blind Assassin</em> does all of the above and does it in a sly, not-pretentious way. In many ways it’s been my almanac of how to write.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What (other than Flyway) literary magazines do you read?</p>
<p>MD: <em>Glimmer Train</em>, <em>The Beloit Fiction Journal</em> and <em>Ecotone</em> have been long time favorites. I also read a lot of online journals, like <em>Paper Darts</em>, <em>Diagram</em>, <em>[PANK]</em>, <em>NAP</em>, <em>Birdfeast</em>, <em>THRUSH</em>, <em>Fiddleback</em>, and <em>Brevity</em>.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</p>
<p>MD: I don’t really search for specific writers, I usually just bounce around and read whatever peaks my interest. Lately, I keep coming across stories by Lauren Groff and I’ve loved everything of hers.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Is there an aspect of the writing life, or the writing industry, that deserves more attention than it gets?</p>
<p>MD: I have these magnificent dreams of a world where poetry is as widespread as something like, let’s say, &#8220;Keeping up with the Kardashians.&#8221; Although really high quality fiction and nonfiction can make it into pop culture, I wish poetry had the spotlight more often. And really in this instant gratification, 150 character, fast paced time, you’d think poetry would be the go-to form of reading. Quick, powerful, BOOM. It blows you off your feet in a way that &#8220;Keeping up with the Kardashians&#8221; just can’t.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What advice do you have for potential-contributors of Flyway?</p>
<p>MD: We really are open to broad, strange, sideways takes on the “environment.” Although I love a good wilderness work with sweeping Steinbeck setting descriptions, I’m more intrigued by something a little different. Show us something with a little whimsy or grit. Show us an urban environment, an anti-environment, a volcanic, crepuscular, moonscape environment. Also, read some work from <em>Flyway</em> before you submit to see what we’re all about. It’s free! Also, please read our submission guidelines and label your work with the correct genre. A writer that can’t read is worrisome indeed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Stefanie Brook Trout</p>
<p>At the end of each academic year, the current <i>Flyway</i> editors step down, and an eager batch of new editors rises to take their places. But what do those outgoing editors do after they are done working on <i>Flyway</i>? Write, of course!</p>
<p>So, <i>Flyway</i> readers, you don’t have to say goodbye to the amazing outgoing editors who assembled a beautiful print anthology, launched an elegant new website that allows you to enjoy <i>Flyway</i> for free, and graciously mentored the incoming folks on how to keep <i>Flyway</i> wonderful. You can still enjoy the fruits of their creative labors by following their work as writers.</p>
<p>Here are a few links to online publications by Chris Wiewiora, Lydia Melby, Lindsay Tigue, Andrew Payton, and Lindsay D’Andrea to get you started. Happy reading!</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.riverandsoundreview.org/Nonfiction/Issue7/Wiewiora.htm" target="_blank"><i>Witamy Spodwrotem</i></a><a href="http://www.riverandsoundreview.org/Nonfiction/Issue7/Wiewiora.htm" target="_blank">/Welcome Back</a>” by Managing Editor Chris Wiewiora (From <i>A River &amp; Sound Review</i>)</p>
<p>Chris says this personal essay about returning to his childhood home in Warsaw, Poland, is the first piece he wrote in Iowa State University’s MFA program. Yes, you read that right. He was this good when he got to us. “Welcome Back,” which “focuses on memory and the overlap/replacement of the present on the past,” will be a part of Chris’s thesis, a nonfiction book that I cannot wait to read after getting this sneak peek.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2011-02-04/fruit/" target="_blank">Fruit</a>” by Fiction Editor Lydia Melby (From <i>The Austin Chronicle</i>)</p>
<p>Lydia took second place in the <i>Austin Chronicle’s</i> 19th Annual Short Story Contest with this engrossing fiction piece. She challenged conventions by narrating “Fruit” in the second person, a difficult mode that, when done well, inserts the reader directly into the story (even if some of the revolting imagery is so vivid that you might wish you weren’t). But of course, because Lydia does it so expertly, you’ll be glad to inhabit the protagonist’s skin, brie-like puss and all.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://barnstormjournal.org/poetry/linear-foreign-bodies/" target="_blank">Linear Foreign Bodies</a>” by Nonfiction Editor Lindsay Tigue (From <i>Barnstorm</i>)</p>
<p>Lindsay packs a lot of truth into this poem about a cat that eats elastics. “Linear Foreign Bodies” stretches the elasticity of a sentence just like the stretched rubber in the cat’s stomach. One long enjambed thought captures a meandering stream of consciousness. We see deep-seated mania, social anxiety caused by crowding, and a charming weirdness in the series of thoughts. One of the best parts of this poem is the opportunity Lindsay gave her readers to mentally punctuate the sentence in different ways, so we can experience the poem differently each time.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.juked.com/2012/03/repairs.asp" target="_blank">Repairs</a>” by Poetry Editor Andrew Payton (From <i>Juked</i>)</p>
<p>In a series of couplets, Andrew provides a populist narrative after the fashion of postmodernist poetry. “Repairs” parallels the images of the mechanic and the butcher, the machine and the organism. As the uncle repairs the narrator’s Pontiac (and drinks Natty Light), the aunt butchers a deer. The clipped form of the couplets imitates the whirlwind of emotion implicated in clipped, rural speech. A marked eeriness pervades the narrative as the nameless aunt and uncle nonchalantly mix oil and blood, and by the end of the poem, we begin question whether we view the natural environment as dispassionately as we do a broken down car.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://indigestmag.com/blog/?p=16579#.UYkC17WG0pk" target="_blank">The Salt Collector</a>” by Creative Director Lindsay D’Andrea (From <i>InDigest Magazine</i>)</p>
<p>Lindsay says it best: “The piece is about grief, and was inspired by the installations of Japanese artist, <a href="http://www.motoi.biz/english/e_top/e_top.html" target="_blank">Motoi Yamamoto</a> […]. In Japan, salt is an important part of the culture surrounding death. Sometimes, bowls of salt are featured at funerals. I set the story in a sleepy beach town in order to explore how a presence of salt might physically begin to overwhelm a grieving man&#8217;s life.” The tension of this beautiful story builds quietly as we learn more about the characters and as they learn more about their relationship. The salt evinces surrealism in the story, but we never question the realism of the characters.</p>
<p>And just for fun (and trust me, it’s fun), be sure to check out “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZMvWEtCA8s&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Millions</a>,” a poem written and read by Nonfiction Editor Lindsay Tigue in this short stop-motion film adaptation animated by Creative Director Lindsay D’Andrea and <i>Flyway</i> friend Geetha Iyer.</p>
<p>On behalf of the incoming staff and <i>Flyway’s</i> readers, I want to both thank the outgoing editors for their hard work on the journal and applaud their talent as writers.</p>
<p>On behalf of all of us at <i>Flyway</i>, thanks to you for reading!</p>

<p>Items of interest or related to some of <em>Flyway</em>&#8216;s incoming editors.</p>
<p><a title="The Cave by Tobias" href="http://themoonlitroad.com/the-cave/" target="_blank">The Cave</a>, by Harris Tobias (from <em>The</em> <em>Moonlit Road</em>)</p>
<p>As someone who went spelunking frequently when I lived in the southeast, I tried to find a story that captured the experience.  The family-owned caves turned roadside-tourist-traps described are par for this area of the country.</p>
<p><a title="Poems by Michelle Donahue" href="http://www.menacinghedge.com/spring2013/entry-donahue.php#night" target="_blank">Poems by Michelle Donahue</a>: &#8220;Tell Tesla,&#8221; &#8220;After Light,&#8221; and &#8220;Night in the Burning House&#8221; (from <em>Menacing Hedge</em>)</p>
<p>Three poems by Michelle Donahue, whose primary genre is fiction but who shows off her poetry chops in these three short pieces, accompanied by an audio file.</p>
<p><a title="Poems by Claire Kruesel" href="http://www.menacinghedge.com/spring2013/entry-kruesel.php" target="_blank">Poems by Claire Kruesel</a>: &#8220;Intrauterine device (IUD).  9 a.m., Planned Parenthood.&#8221; and &#8220;Scarabaeidae&#8221; (from <em>Menacing Hedge</em>)</p>
<p>Two poems by Flyway&#8217;s incoming poetry editor Claire Kruesel, first runner-up in ISU&#8217;s &#8220;Home Voices&#8221; contest, and who recently read some of her work at our Wildness Symposium.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last, meet <em>Flyway&#8217;s </em>creative director/ web czaress, <strong>Lindsay D&#8217;Andrea</strong>. You can find her updating the blog, tweeting, managing our Facebook page, and helping layout issue design. Consider her a behind-the-scenes editor.</p>
<div id="attachment_830" style="width: 376px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/newhair1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-830" class=" wp-image-830     " title="Lindsay D'Andrea" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/newhair1.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="302" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-830" class="wp-caption-text">Lindsay, with her most creative hair</p></div>
<p><strong><br />
What book can you not stop talking to people about?<br />
</strong>Ever since we circulated Anthony Doerr&#8217;s books around before last year&#8217;s <em>Wildness Symposium</em>, it&#8217;s been his collection of short stories, <em>The Shell Collector</em>. I just can&#8217;t get over how textured, heart-rending, complex, and epic Doerr stories are, and I recommend them to everyone. If you haven&#8217;t read it yet, that needs to be the first thing on your list. Starting now.</p>
<p><strong><br />
What book compels your writing?</strong><em></em><br />
I&#8217;ve read a lot of books on craft &#8212; too many, I think. Obviously <em>The Art of Fiction</em> is a staple. More than reading, though, I learn most from my professors and peers and the invaluable advice they give. Actually, from a different perspective, I feel most compelled to write by reading poetry<strong>, </strong>and my go-to (for now) has been  Stephen Dunn.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?<br />
I jump all over the place, sampling from a bunch of different online and print journals. I really like <em>Hayden&#8217;s Ferry</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, <em>Ecotone</em> (hurray for environmentally-minded journals!),<em> Necessary Fiction, the Rumpus, Orion, The Southern Review, AQR</em> &#8212; plus a lot more. I also love the visual art featured on <em>Escape into Life</em> and <em>Society 6</em>.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?<br />
Oh, gosh. I usually look for writers that have been on my &#8220;must-read-more&#8221; list like Karen Russell, Lauren Groff and Meghan Mayhew Bergman, but usually I read journals for the unknowns (like myself). I will just pick stories and poems at random and read them, with hope that someone out there is doing the same for me. I usually then try to follow those emerging writers on Twitter. Our technological internet-driven age means that reading shouldn&#8217;t be passive anymore&#8230;our capacity for communication is too great to ignore.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?<br />
Send us your best! A lot of times I feel like we get stories that have not been polished or edited properly or extensively. We have pretty high standards, here, and we always want the best you can give. For visual art, I look for interesting composition (in photographs) or complex relationships between visual elements. Obviously, we &#8220;like&#8221; plants and rocks and fields and pastorals, but that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re really about&#8230;surprise us with your new ideas about the environment&#8230;it&#8217;s changing at a rate that can no longer sustain a boxed-in definition.<strong></strong></p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Poetry</span>: Maurice Manning – <em>A Common Man </em>and <em>A</em> <em>Companion for Owls</em><em><br />
</em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Short Story<em>:</em></span> Anthony Doerr – <em>The Shell Collector</em><em><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><br />
Often the last book I read compels my writing, and when I feel stalled and uninspired I might return to something by some of my favorites: Wendell Berry, William Stafford, Seamus Heaney, Mary Oliver, Galway Kinnell, Pablo Neruda, Salvatore Quasimodo, Sharon Olds, Louise Gluck, and Yusef Komunyakaa. This list probably keeps going.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than Flyway) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I’ll typically read whatever falls into my hand or strikes my momentary interest. But a few magazines I return to, subscribe to, or prefer: Cave <em>Wall</em>, <em>Appalachian Heritage</em>, <em>Whitefish Review</em>, <em>One Story</em>, <em>Ecotone</em>, <em>The Sun</em>, <em>The Paris Review</em>, and <em>Poetry</em>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
They may all be super famous already, but these names would definitely pique my interest in a journal: Track K Smith, Bob Hicok, Sandra Beasley, Aimee Nezhukumatathil, D.A. Powell, Maurice Manning, Frank X Walker, Linda Pastan, Natasha Trethewey, or Geoffrey Brock.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of Flyway?</strong><br />
Read books. Read magazines. Read <em>Flyway</em>! Write and submit and plant trees.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our new <em>Flyway</em> fiction editor, Lydia Melby, is straight outta Texas (but don&#8217;t tell her I told you). Read below for more important information.</p>
<div id="attachment_821" style="width: 319px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/220038_808697576957_1520514839_o.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-821" class=" wp-image-821     " title="Lydia with Wolf Pup" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/220038_808697576957_1520514839_o.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="232" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-821" class="wp-caption-text">Lydia with Wolf Pup</p></div>
<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><em><br />
The God of Small Things</em>. <em>Ship Breaker</em>. Mary Karr’s memoirs. Do I need to pick one? Sometimes I want to read a fast-paced YA novel about the futuristic Gulf communities complete with clipper ship chase scenes, and sometimes I want to read a lovely, lyrical novel dissecting how small choices and small betrayals can all pile together for a catastrophic end. Sometimes I want to read a fellow Texan’s sassy-assed recounting of her life and thoughts about religion, family, and writing. I’m reading <em>The Night Circus</em> right now, too, and it’s fantastic—it’s difficult to stay on track with my class readings when I have such a lively, brilliant story within reach. I’ve been putting it away in my room when I work.</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><em><br />
The English Patient</em>, ultimately (or really, anything by Ondaatje). I’ve never read a more perfectly realized, more devastating book (though <em>The God of Small Things</em> and <em>The Cat’s Table </em>come close). I read<em> Stay Awake </em>this summer and was floored. I’m reading it for the third time now—Chaon’s eerie lyricism is so subtle and so atmospheric that you get that ringing in your ears.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I read <em>The Fairy Tale Review, The Southern Review, American Short Fiction </em>(please don’t shut down!)<em>, Ecotone, Idaho Review, Gulf Coast, Bellevue, Bat City, </em>and<em> Fiddleblack, </em>cover to cover, and really love<em> The Collagist, DrunkenBoat,  Fwriction, Pank, Lit, Granta, The Paris Review, The Atlantic, A Capella Zoo, Pleiades, Ninth Letter, Sonora Review</em> and too many to really name.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
Upper Middle Class White Male Authors. Especially if they’re long-established voices, have published several times, and are writing about hetero-normative relationships taking place in New York City/LA/The Midwest. I really like it when their narrator is speaking in first person present, is frustrated with how he’s not understood by family/society, and/or has an epiphany about how their wife/ girlfriend/ new baby makes them feel trapped.</p>
<p>Obviously (I hope), that’s sarcasm. I look for writers that can shock me, writers I don’t necessarily recognize, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
I feel like a lot of current short stories tend to ignore the necessity of a compelling plot to lean on other elements—like an idiosyncratic voice, or really detailed descriptions. I don’t mean that I’d rather mostly plot, but I’m looking for balanced stories—and yeah, that’s hard to do.</p>
<p>Personally, I really enjoy tension and a sense of mystery. Or, to quote Raymond Carver, I want to read stories with at least &#8220;a little menace…There has to be tension, a sense that something is imminent, that certain things are in relentless motion, or else, most often, there simply won&#8217;t be a story.&#8221;</p>
<p>For <em>Flyway</em> in particular, there should be tension between the environment or setting of the story and the characters in it. A well-known place should appear new, even alien and strange through the eyes and actions of the characters. I want to see an active environment, too—a setting that influences actions, triggers it’s one events.</p>
<p>One of my professors has a Dianne Arbus photo on his wall—the one of the frustrated little boy holding a grenade in central park—and he pointed out part of what makes the photo so memorable (besides the little critter’s facial contortions) is that she had a special lens that made the background and environment tilted, a little bent-looking, while the foreground was in realistically sharp focus. He said that’s the kind of story he likes to read and write—one where the center is sharp and realistic, and the outer edges are starting to bend or collapse.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What makes our new editorial staff at <em>Flyway</em> tick? What kind of writing gets their hearts pumping and gets them reading after a hard day, week, month, or year in Iowa State University&#8217;s MFA program? Over the next month, you can find out as we introduce each of our new editors.</p>
<p>Up first: <strong>Managing Editor, Chris Wiewiora</strong></p>

<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><em><br />
Fire Season: Notes from a Wilderness Lookout </em>by Philip Connors</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?<em><br />
</em></strong><em>The Writing Life</em><em> </em>by Annie Dillard</p>
<p><strong>What (other than Flyway) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I read a whole helluva lot of them…but I subscribe to <em>River Styx, the Florida Review </em>(of course)<em>, Poetry, The Sun, Cave Wall</em>, and I’m probably forgetting others. Also, online I read a lot of community writing like <em>theRumpus, Hobart, the Millions, PANK, HTML Giant, </em>et al.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
I love to find any piece by Ira Sukrungruang. I like Ben [Percy’s] modern folktales. Billy Collins seems to be in any and all lit mags. Alex Lemon’s poems are solid. Brian Doyle’s prose-poem/auto-fiction/close-to-the-heart-nonfiction. Steve Almond’s love/sex/breakup-stories. Jeffrey Brown’s memoir-and/or-satirical comics. &#8230;Megan Mayhew Berman and her animal stories. Caitlin Horrocks; though, she’s mostly in “the slicks” now. Anything by these two amazing Florida gals: Karen Russell and Laura Van den Berg. Lindsay Hunter’s wild and weird stories!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
Address your cover letters to the appropriate editor. Seriously.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">“Summer is for reading books about the end of the world”<br />
— A friend, on summer reads</p>
<p>Most of what I’ve been reading this summer could be called speculative fiction, or near-future, or post-apocalyptic, or just good ol’ sci-fi. Books about the end of the world fascinate me, and I’ve read some rewardingly sinister predictions, some hopeful projections about rebuilding, and some kooky excuses to dismiss social progress in the name of returning humans to their ‘natural’ state. Among the crumbling governments and strange technologies I’ve been exploring, Paolo Bacigalupi’s whirlwind novel, <em>The Windup Girl</em>, which won the 2010 Hugo and Nebula awards and many other honors, stands apart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/0-9781597801577-0"><img class="aligncenter" title="Wind-up Girl cover" src="http://chamberfour.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/the-windup-girl-shopped.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>The narrative offers Bacigalupi’s startling vision of a world where oil has run out, ending the days of the Old Expansion; where companies like SoyPro, U-Tex, and AgriGen filled the world’s fields with genehacked crops so non-diverse they were wiped out by a couple of engineered plagues, where technology has lead to chameleonic cat infestations and 15-ton elephants are used as work animals, and where “windups”—New People engineered to be strong, beautiful, and instinctually subservient—are used to fulfill human whims.</p>
<p>But Bacigalupi doesn’t spend his time marveling over these strange events and making sure the reader knows precisely how they came about, since these events are history in this world; instead he places his narrative in the days of the “New Expansion,” when nations have rebuilt to some degree, when clipper ships and high-tech dirigibles have become commonplace again, when all technology—from crank-fans to treadle-computers—is powered by human energy, and when civil wars and political coup d’états are again concerns as big as the food supply. He evokes a world that has, at least somewhat, adapted to its own end, and is fighting to survive another.</p>
<p>While this level of complex world-building seems overwhelming at first, Bacigalupi achieves a sense of causality and wholeness in his new world. The reader is not bogged down with superfluous details and explanations of “what went wrong” and “how stuff works now,&#8221; but is rather immersed in a completely fresh era and place which may take some getting used to, but is tangible and constant. By containing his narrative in Bangkok, Thailand, Bacigalupi shows how the worldwide events have radically affected this microcosm, allowing him to reasonably hint at the struggles the rest of the world is facing without writing a 1200 page novel.</p>
<p>He also gives a multi-faceted view of the Bangkok microcosm, as the narrative rotates among four main characters—Emiko, the mysterious ‘windup’ of the title; Anderson Lake, a ‘calorie man’ spy sent by the megalithic AgriGen to seek out Thailand’s seedbank in hope of “generipping” its riches; Tan Hock Seng, a former shipping king and “yellow card” (Chinese refugee), who schemes to regain his former wealth and status; and Captain Jaidee Rojjanasukchai of the Thai Environment Ministry, called “The Tiger of Bangkok” for his fierce dedication to the environmental health of the city he loves. These four are joined by an array of supporting characters just as diverse (but not to worry, Bacigalupi’s taken care to give them memorable names, e.g. “Dog Fucker”).</p>
<p>But the true protagonist of the story is Bacigalupi’s city of Bangkok, or Krung Thep, depending on the narrator’s nationality. He has clearly done his research on the challenges facing present-day Thailand, and offers a vision of a struggling nation’s capital fighting rising sea levels and rampant disease mutations. While each of the human characters fight for their own interests and reveal their own dark sides, it’s this hopeful, but broken city in a strange and broken world that the reader comes to care for most in the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://windupstories.com"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://windupstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/paolobacigalupi300dpi.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="253" /></a></p>
<p>While I’m partial to as many characters as one can stuff into a story, some readers might find the story crowded; likewise, Bacigalupi’s constantly shifting narrative, and one particularly daring perspective shift, might contradict expected storytelling ‘rules’. However, these characters—each of different ethnicity and social standing, each with their own complex loyalties and desires—are one of the elements that set this story apart from other speculative fiction or futuristic novels.</p>
<p><em>The Windup Girl</em> isn’t strictly a cautionary tale (though one might wish certain FDA officials would read it), and it’s not a trip through one writer’s imaginative paranoia, either. The novel is Bacigalupi’s vision of our world in a possible future—a frightening, exciting, and even sometimes hopeful vision of what happens when resources are abused, communities taken for granted, and everyone—deserving or not—gets what is coming.</p>
