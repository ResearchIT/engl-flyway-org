								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>By Ana Hurtado</b></p>
<p><b>AH: Where do you call <i>home</i>? Why? What makes this place <i>home </i>for you?</b></p>
<p>LG: I’m from Reading, Pennsylvania, like <i>Reading Railroad </i>on the Monopoly board; that’s actually where it’s from. What makes Reading <i>home</i> is not just the fact that I grew up there, but that all of my family grew up there. I identify really strongly with that area.</p>
<p><b>AH: How do you say your last name?</b></p>
<p>LG: ˈjȯr(ˌ)jē-</p>
<p><b>AH: Italian?</b></p>
<p>LG: Yes. My dad’s family actually lives in a small borough outside of Reading called Temple. It’s populated by a lot of Italians whose ancestors are all from the same area in Italy, called Ascoli Piceno. The Italian community in this area is especially small and close.</p>
<p><b>AH: What is your home place&#8217;s defining characteristic? What is unique about this place? </b></p>
<p>LG: It’s an interesting area. It’s in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, and it kind of has some of the Appalachian mountain culture, although it’s sort of at the northern end of Appalachia. The area where I grew up was, historically, mostly composed of farms. It’s also known for its Amish population; it’s the area where most of the country’s Amish originate.</p>
<p>Culturally, that makes it very distinct. The culture is referred to as “Pennsylvania German,” but if you’re actually from there, we call it “Pennsylvania Dutch.” That’s also the name of a dialect of German that’s spoken in Pennsylvania. The language is dying among the non-Amish communities, but there are elements of it in the English that we speak in that area. I grew up speaking this weird dialect of English that is, occasionally, incomprehensible to outsiders. We put our prepositional phrases in strange places and we use phrases that don’t make sense to others. I didn’t learn that until I went away to college in Boston University to study journalism; I didn’t know I used this dialect until people there pointed it out.</p>
<p>I identify really strongly with the mountains. Reading is in a confluence of different regions: farmland and Pennsylvania German culture and the mountains and former coal country. It was an interesting area to grow up, but I didn’t really know that until I moved away.</p>
<p><b>AH: What kind of writing excites you? What can&#8217;t you put down? What are you reading right now for <i>you</i>, your own aesthetic?</b></p>
<p>LG: I recently started writing poetry. I come from a journalism background, and so I’m more familiar with fiction and nonfiction. Fiction is what I was initially interested in when I came to ISU, and then nonfiction is what I’ve been writing, you know, career-wise.</p>
<p>And so I’ve been discovering a lot of contemporary poets. It’s been very exciting and rewarding.</p>
<p>In my poetry, I’ve been writing personal narratives and looking at science and the natural world; I’ve been trying to integrate this metaphorically in my poems. I’ve been getting a lot of recommendations about poetry. I just picked up <i>Life on Mars</i> by Tracy K. Smith.</p>
<p>But I tend to read whatever I come across. When people recommend things, or I read something in a blog, I tend to pick that up. I am not a directed reader; I like to have things come to me. I collect books.</p>
<p>I just picked up <i>The Blind Assassin</i> by Margaret Atwood. I was trying to describe my thesis project to a friend, and she said, “You need to read this book,” and she loaned it to me, and so that’s what I’m currently reading. And this summer I moved into a new place and the former residents left behind a lot of their books, and so I read Joan Didion’s <i>The Year of Magical Thinking</i>, which was amazing and sad. She writes about her husband’s unexpected death, and kind of chronicles the process of grieving.</p>
<p><b>AH: For readers and those submitting to <i>Flyway</i>, what advice can you give? What do you look for in the pieces you publish in <i>Flyway</i>?</b></p>
<p>LG: Looking at the art submissions, I would say that we get a lot of nature photography, and I am not as excited about that as I am about an artist who does more of a unique take on the idea of <i>environment</i> or <i>place</i> or the interaction of people in nature or in a specific environment. We recently featured an artist named Elizabeth Castaldo, for example; she did these amazing mixed media pieces – she constructed collages using fashion magazines, photographs, and interpretations of cells and trees in watercolor. They were amazing, and beautiful, and colorful.</p>
<p>So I would encourage submitters to think more broadly about the definition of <i>place </i>or <i>environment</i> and how that could be reflected in the art that they’re doing. If you’re going to be submitting nature photography, that critical bar is going to be very high.</p>
<p><b>AH: How does the idea of place or environment factor in to that?</b></p>
<p>LG: I’m really intrigued by the idea of how humans interact with the environment and the relationship between humans the natural world, between people and the places that they live. And I think that that is where some of the most exciting work I’ve seen comes into play. An artist should examine that idea and find unique interpretations of that idea.</p>
<p><b> </b><b>AH: How do you define <i>environment? </i>How is that definition important to you?</b></p>
<p>LG: I think that’s a question that lends itself more easily to some of the other genres we publish than it does to the idea of visual art. <i>Environment</i>, in the context of art, can mean ecology (traditional environmentalism, the natural world), but it can also mean <i>place, setting, </i>or<i> urban landscape</i>. In fact, we’re always excited when we receive works of art that explore urban landscapes because it always tends to be interesting; it is very different from nature photography or nature writing, which could be of a more direct interpretation of our mission. Nature photography can be something that we’re interested in, but it needs to be more than a beautiful landscape. It needs to make an argument.</p>
<p>Being part of the MFA program in Creative Writing &amp; Environment, and being part of <i>Flyway</i>, means we spend a lot of time thinking about how we can interpret environment in our own works. Because of this, I am always interested to see what other artists are doing in this same realm.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamilton-Poore: Where do you call home?</p>
<p>Clark: I call Wisconsin home. It’s where I was raised and where my family is.</p>
<p>Hamilton-Poore: What is your home place’s defining characteristic?</p>
<p>Clark: The defining characteristics of my home are probably woods and hills. Valleys and bluffs are the geographical features which most come to mind.</p>
<p>Hamilton-Poore: What kind of writing excites you? What can’t you put down?</p>
<p>Clark: I’m excited by writing that surprises or amazes me. I lean towards the speculative and the magical realist in writing. I can’t put down something where the writing, the plot, and the characters are well-done. I’m a stay-up-all-night finishing a book sort of reader. Currently I’m reading collections by Miyuki Miyabe and Emily Carroll and I’m about to dive into Emily St. John Mandel’s <i>Station Eleven</i>. Mandel is a writer of gorgeous prose and I can’t wait to read this latest novel.</p>
<p>Hamilton-Poore: For readers and those submitting to <i>Flyway</i>, what advice can you give?</p>
<p>Clark: For submitters to <i>Flyway</i>, my advice is to take risks in your writing. Also, take the “environment” in our journal title to new places: give me a haunted house story or explore a new planet. All of these can be just as much about place as any other story. Place and environment are what a writer makes them.</p>
<p>Hamilton-Poore: What do you look for in pieces you publish for <i>Flyway</i>?</p>
<p>Clark: I look for beautiful writing that also tells a really good story with interestingly complex characters. I don’t think a piece works unless if it has all three of those elements. I also look for old things done in surprising ways—show me a space exploration story that has never been done before.</p>
<p>Hamilton-Poore: How do you define “environment,” and is that definition important to you?</p>
<p>Clark: I define environment as a state of mind. Anything can be an environment if it’s well thought out: a single, unadorned room can be an environment if you make the reader feel like it is a lived-in room.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">By Meghann Hart</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i> blog editor Erin Schmiel brings to the journal an aesthetic deeply influenced by place. In an interview conducted two weeks ago, Schmiel recounted experiences of Cave Point State Park, on the Door County peninsula in Lake Michigan. Here, as a teenager, she often biked to view these limestone cliffs that hung over the water. Something about the unrestricted largeness of Lake Michigan struck her.</p>
<p>“The rocks and cliff face of Cave Point kept bringing me back,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I loved looking out over the water and dreaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>After attending Wisconsin Lutheran College in Milwaukee for two years, she decided to move to Missoula, Montana, a place she knew she could connect with both culturally and geographically. Schmiel had heard rumors of a vibrant writing community and outdoor-based culture, but what really drew her in was Montana’s promise of “big nature”—the vast, panoramic kind that there wasn&#8217;t enough of in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>“Shortly after the move,” she said, “I began work as a trail crew leader for the Montana Conservation Corps (MCC), and from May to November, I would spend ten-day stints on trails in ecosystems drastically different from those of Wisconsin. During this time, I learned that Montana’s large mountains and valleys weren’t nearly as difficult to traverse as I had originally thought.”</p>
<p>While Montana’s landscape challenged her both mentally and physically, its strong writing community nurtured her evolving aesthetic. At the University of Montana (UM), she studied under naturalist and writer Rick Bass who inculcated in her the importance of finding—and writing—the secret heart of each story.</p>
<p>“Writing the secret heart of each story is a major part of my aesthetic. It’s the glue that holds my work together and helps answer that “so-what?” question that all readers ask.”</p>
<p>While at UM, she also studied eco-criticism, an experience that helped her clarify her own understanding of environment and how this conception informed her aesthetic.</p>
<p>“I like to think about environment in terms of ecology,” she said, “this notion that everything is connected. At UM, I started to think more deeply about ecology and how it had influenced my writing through an eco-criticism course I took, in which I learned how literature informs the environment through the theories of Mikail Bakhtin and Ursula K. Le Guin. This helped me better ground my own thinking about environment in the theoretical soil of ecology and literature.”<i></i></p>
<p>Other important aesthetic influences for her include Robert Stubblefield, her mentor at UM, and Gary Snyder, Joan Didion, and <i>Harper</i><i>’s Magazine</i>—and, of course, Rick Bass.</p>
<p>“I pick up everything Rick Bass writes,” she said, “and his recent piece about the western larch, in which he discusses his love affair with this tree and why it serves as the identifying feature of a place for him, I found deeply affective—it particularly stirred me.”</p>
<p>Still, as an invested and innovative writer, she is always on the lookout for new inspiration.</p>
<p>“I’ve been told to read Marilynne Robinson because she writes about family and faith, which are two of my major joint-interests,” Schmiel said.</p>
<p>For those who wish to submit to Flyway, Schmiel shared what she hoped to see in each submission.</p>
<p>“As a blog editor, I get to publish the web roves, reviews, and interviews that I assign. I look for a lot of heart in everything I read. As long as a piece has heart, and as long I can see that the writer has really engaged with what they have written—both personally and at the level of craft—that’s what I look for.”</p>
<p>She also offered some more directive words of wisdom.</p>
<p><i> </i>“Write what you’re passionate about,” she said, “work really hard at it, and don’t give up when the writing is tough. Be persistent in your research, in your editing, and in your submitting.  One day, that most beautiful thing that you’ve always wanted to produce will emerge.”</p>
<p>In both her personal writing and work she solicits for <i>Flyway, </i>Schmiel has an aesthetic deeply influenced by place.</p>
<p>“Place is my starting point,” she said, “I use maps to see where places physically are before I begin writing about them. I’ve looked at highway 43 in Wisconsin for a short story; I’ve looked at South America and volcanic chains and plate tectonics. Maps are evocative. They help me better understand the narrative possibilities that exist for a given piece situated in a given place. I love maps, and I have to start there.”</p>

		<title>From the Rockies to Right Whales: the Aesthetic Places of Kelly Slivka</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Interview by Cathleen Chittenden Bascom</p>
<p dir="ltr">Flyway managing editor Kelly Slivka calls the open, arid landscape of the Colorado Rockies home. A rooted familiarity with the region comes through in small indicators like the absence of insects or the constant need for lotion. Slivka knows intimately the details of the mountains and canyonlands of the western United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I totally ascribe,” Slivka says, “to the idea that West is best.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet, even as a very small child, Slivka was also profoundly drawn to the ocean.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When I was just a baby, my mom took me to the ocean in Hawaii,” Slivka said. “She says she knew right then she was going to lose me to the ocean someday. And that’s what happened. I love Denver and the Rockies, but my future will be near water.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">For three years as a trained ecologist specializing in large whale biology, Slivka followed the seasonal migratory paths of humpback and right whales. From Boston to the whale calving grounds of northern Florida and Georgia, Slivka worked on a converted lobster boat doing I.D. and behavioral studies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Just as the large scale of the landscape west of the Rockies resonates with Slivka, so does the scale of the  “dark, brooding, roiling, slate-green” sea of the north Atlantic. As for Melville, for Slivka the aggressive, northern  ocean “seems to speak of some hidden soul beneath.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Certain earthscapes have that existential nature that puts us in our place. To me it’s comforting to confront our own smallness.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maybe it comes from gazing into the sky from the deck of a boat, but when asked about recent writing that impresses her, Slivka lauds Cloud Atlas, the 2004 novel by David Mitchell. She said she appreciates the caliber of the storytelling, especially the narrative complexity evident as the author weaves five or six stories together.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Flyway, Slivka seeks well-crafted, ripe pieces “that are redolent of their environment.” Even when place isn’t the point, Slivka seeks settings fully portrayed sensually, full of textures and odors as well as visual specificity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I like it when place is like a living thing.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">*-*</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Samantha Futhey</p>
<p><i>Natalie Diaz grew up in the Fort Mojave Indian Village in Needles, California, on the banks of the Colorado River. She is Mojave and an enrolled member of the Gila River Indian Community. After playing professional basketball in Europe and Asia for several years, she completed an MFA in poetry and fiction from Old Dominion University in 2007. She currently lives in Mohave Valley, Arizona, and directs a language revitalization program at Fort Mojave, her home reservation. There she works with the last Elder speakers of the Mojave language. </i>When My Brother Was an Aztec<i>, published in 2012 by Copper Canyon Press, is her first poetry collection.</i></p>
<p><i>This interview was conducted at Iowa State University’s Memorial Union, during the Wilderness Symposium, a series of lectures sponsored by ISU’s Creative Writing and Environment MFA program. It has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
<p><i>Futhey</i>: I read in your bio that you used to play basketball professionally, which I find fascinating. After that whole experience, what made you decide to go back to writing, or did you start writing at Old Dominion and come back to it after your basketball career?</p>
<p><i>Diaz</i>: I’ve always liked to read and write, but I never read poetry. I was training at Old Dominion to continue to play basketball — I had a contract to play in another country, and I was ready to go. I blew my knee out during one of my practices, and I had to do rehab. There’s an expedited rehab process, but I decided to just take the full six months. A few of my undergrad professors who I’d kept in touch with were teaching in the creative writing department at Old Dominion and let me enroll without being a part of the program yet, which was very generous of them. I mean, it wasn’t free, of course; they weren’t that generous (<i>Laughs</i>). So I took a bunch of workshops and I decided that I liked it. I think had I not been injured, and maybe had I not been injured there, I might not have given myself the time ever to see if I wanted to be a writer.</p>
<p><i>F</i>: Why does poetry attract you?</p>
<p><i>D</i>: You know, I don’t know. I also write fiction, but I fell into poetry — maybe because some of the physical rhythms are similar to basketball. I didn’t see it at the time, but now that I can look back in retrospect, I feel like my poetry mirrors some of the rhythms of basketball — or maybe the way I played basketball. Sometimes it’s very fast paced, and it’s accumulating, and there’s a lot of momentum and momentum switches.</p>
<p>Poetry still feels very physical to me, because you’re trying to be concise, and every word counts. It’s like on the court: You don’t just go out there and run around like crazy. Spacing is important, and that’s how my lines feel to me. I can see the rhythm and spacing of them, whereas with fiction, I don’t feel that as much, because there is more space. Maybe it’s more like soccer — heck of a lot bigger field for sure (<i>Laughs</i>). But I’ve been thinking about basketball and my poetry a lot, partly because people have mentioned it to me, that they see some of the connections between the two, the momentum and rhythms of it.</p>
<p><i>F</i>: I’d certainly agree to that. In, <i>When My Brother Was an Aztec</i> your poetry collection that came out a few years ago, you employ such stunning use of image. The images were unexpected in their development and created fast-paced rhythms (as in first lines of “When My Brother Was an Aztec”: “He thought he was/ <i>Huitzilopochtli</i>, a god, half-man half-hummingbird. My parents/ at his feet, wrecked honeysuckles, he lowered his swordlike mouth,/ gorged on them, draining color until their eyebrows whitened”). Can you describe your creative process while you were writing that collection of poems?</p>
<p><i>D</i>: With any writing, whether it’s poetry or fiction, I start with an image. So I start very small. One, because my mind is a little bit wild: It’s very noisy, and I get excited about every little thing. Every word is a rabbit hole for me, so I can get very far from where I need to be. I try to focus on a single image, and one of the things I try to do is break it. So whatever that image is —whatever it is I’m seeing or trying to figure out how I feel about — I try to break it into as many pieces as possible.</p>
<p>Entomology is really important to me. The history of the word, the mythology of that word, where it comes from, how it’s been used before in other literatures&#8230; I try to figure out what the image means to <i>me</i> instead of letting it mean what it’s already meant to other people. I have this faith that if I can find a way to make that image or word new to me again, brand new, it will be brand new to my reader as well. I don’t mean brand new as in I feel I have to be fantastical and do back flips, but emotionally, which is sometimes difficult with poems like “When My Brother was an Aztec.” It’s about my brother, and for me, I could never write about my brother. I would never be able to tell you how I feel about him, but if I can create an image to hold or smash or cage the emotions I’m feeling, then that’s what I pour all my emotional energy into. And then I don’t have to be sentimental, then I don’t have to write about my brother, because now I’m creating an image. I think that’s what my readers feel, because again no one’s been to my house or my reservation, but they are still able to come to those images or the narratives the images built and feel something. Most importantly, it becomes theirs not mine anymore. That’s what I notice when I have conversations with people about it. They feel like they know me or that I know them, and none of that is true, except the emotional truth is there on the page. I think the images are what let people access that.</p>
<p><i>F</i>: You mentioned your brother, and a lot of the poems in that collection talk about serious issues: reservation life, poverty, drug addiction. I also noticed your use of form. There’s the pantoum in “My Brother at 3 am” and the abecedarian, which has one of my favorite titles of the whole collection (“Abecedarian Requiring Further Examination of Anglikan Seraphym Subjugation of a Wild Indian Rezervation”). How do you use form? Was that a deliberate choice to use a structured form in order to talk about some of the more serious aspects of the book?</p>
<p><i>D</i>: I used to hate form when I was in my MFA program. Every time I’d have an assignment, I would just go blank. I was rebelling against it — I would not write it, and everything would shut down. My very first form poem was the abecedarian, and I wrote that because my instructor Gloria told me in class, “I’ve never read any good narrative abecedarians. I haven’t read any good narratives poems in that form.” And that was my challenge to it.</p>
<p>I’ve always needed a way to break form, and that’s never the way it’s given to you. It’s, “This is what you have to do.”  So when she gave it to me with this off-handed challenge, it was almost like she was saying this needed to be broken, so that let me into it. I think form is important to me, especially because of certain emotions, because we don’t even understand them. I think the whole point of writing poetry is to figure out what we feel or why we feel that way. I always saw form as a cage, but what I realized is in the boundaries of it, you don’t have anything to worry about. This is as far as you can go on either side. And there was a freedom in that, so I found a lot of freedom in form to go places I wouldn’t normally have gone.</p>
<p>“My Brother at 3 am” is a pantoum. I had a conversation with my mother, and it was bothering me for months, and I didn’t know how to access it or what to do with it. And writing for me is the way I access a lot of things. But I couldn’t access this thing my mother had recounted to me while I was away. So what I did was I read Cecilia Woloch’s “Bareback Pantoum,” and I felt something comforting in the rhythm of it. So I sat down and took two images — my mother opening a door and my brother crying on the front steps in the middle of the night — and I pushed them and pushed them and pushed them. I tried to bring in dialog, snippets of what my mother told me on the phone, and by the time I got into the second page, the poem started. I didn’t have to worry, because I was so focused on the repetition that I got to disconnect from some of the filters we normally have. Form frees us. The filter is already there the boundaries are already there, so now I can relax, I don’t have to worry. I can’t go too far and I’m going to go at least this far. So form for me — especially triolet, pantoum, the ghazal, that repetition — makes me discover new things.</p>
<p><i>F</i>: When I’m trying to write in form, it takes me a long time to figure out how exactly to approach it. As I was reading poems from this collection, I wondered how long it took you to write the book. Did some poems take longer to write, to process, or were others just immediate?</p>
<p><i>D</i>: I’m a really hard worker, and I do a ton of revision. For example, I don’t believe in writer’s block, because I don’t <i>have</i> to write a poem. I know I can work with it, and I know there’s something in there, maybe just a simple word I can pull from it. I do a lot of free writing. I always have a notebook. I write a lot. Even if I don’t have time, I trust I can sketch out enough of a poem, so when I get an idea or impulse, I stop and write down as much as I can and go from there.</p>
<p>In my MFA, I started writing my first real poems in my third year. It took me that long. My program was three years, and also I was not a writer, was not a poet, had not been reading poetry. But finally, my third year, I wrote things that surprised me, so I knew they were something. And I just continued to write after my MFA. It was 2007 when I started writing real poems, and then I continued in 2008 and 2009. I was writing for three years. But even when I had the book ready, three months before press, I completely revised all of them.</p>
<p>In my next collection, I have poems I tried writing in my MFA program. I just finished a couple of them, and they feel good to me, but it’s taken me since 2007. I always thought it was crazy when old white guys would say, “Oh I wrote this poem for seven years,” and I was like, “What? You’re crazy! You have anything else to do?” But now that I’m treating myself as a writer, I notice my growth a lot more, and I’m a lot more patient.</p>
<p>A lot of my friends, contemporaries like James Arthur, Tomas Morraine, Roger Reeves — people my age who I’ve been getting to know the last few years — have books that took five years to produce, and in those five years they’ve grown, and they’ve grown within those poems. Sometimes a poem will happen a little more quickly, but my guess is that when I put this final manuscript together for the next book, I’ll tweak everything. That being said, lately I don’t mind reading poems when they’re really new. I might read some this evening. They’ve been around for three or four months, but I know I’ll change the heck out of them. My process can be very long.</p>
<p><i>F</i>: You mentioned that you have another book coming out, so I was wondering what other projects you have going on. What are you most interested in exploring at this point in your writing?</p>
<p><i>D</i>: My new book is slated for the end of 2015, but I have the option of saying I’m not ready if I want to.</p>
<p>I think the third half of “When My Brother Was An Aztec” moves towards this new book. I think a lot of people read my first book chronologically, so they assume the third half — poems about love or war — is where my work has been growing towards. But I wrote all those poems around the same time.</p>
<p>A lot of my poems now are looking at home, my reservation, but in a very different way. There’s a lot more about my language work, about the layers of language I’ve been working with. And I’m writing at home — before, I was writing about home away from home, so that’s completely different. There are still brother poems (people have had a lot of strange comments about that, like, “You’re still writing brother poems?”). But I’m just going to write what I have to write. Still, it’s very different. I noticed that in my first book, I was often not in the poems, or if I was, it was a very small “i.” But in the poems I’m writing now, the “i” and the brother are largely the only two people in the poems. One reason this is the case is because I’m home, but also I’m thirty-five and so I’m much older now, and my relationship with my brother is complex, and same with my family. I’ve changed in the way I see his change it and the way I feel about it.</p>
<p>The new book is tentatively titled “Native American Berserk.” But I don’t know that the book is wildly different. I didn’t all-of-the sudden switch to writing nature poems, yet it’s an older speaker now.</p>
<p>That wasn’t a very straightforward answer (<i>Laughs</i>).</p>
<p><i>F</i>: No, no that was great answer! Finally, what advice would you give to new writers or people who struggle to find their place in writing?</p>
<p><i>D</i>: This is kind of lame, but read. I remember when Sherman Alexie came and spoke at my school — this was the first time I’d met him — and asked everyone in the audience, “Who are you reading? Who are you’re writers?” And most people had no answer. You can read anything you want, but you have to know your writers. And if you don’t know your writers, you’re probably not reading enough. Borges — that’s my guy. I go back to him again and again. Or Lorca, or Yehuda Amichai. I go back to them all the time. Those are mine. And they are all threaded through my books.</p>
<p>I think another piece of good advice is to be patient. It seems like everybody’s scrambling to be published or be known, but the best advice I got was that you only get one shot at a first book. And you only get one shot at a second book. So you have to be patient. I’m very patient — too patient. My press had to ask me if I wanted to put out another book, because I’m not publishing-crazy. I do think it’s important, of course. I keep trying to tell my students: Be patient, give your poem a chance to be what it is, what it wants to be.</p>
<p>Those two are really big points. Also, don’t put pressure on yourself to write. A mentor of mine once explained to me that our lives are in so much flux, the hardest part about writing is always trying to relearn whatever rhythm you need so that you can write within that. Just understand that you have to continually adapt and find new ways to write, because we hear other people’s stories and we say, “Oh they get up at 4:30 every morning!” That’s completely unrealistic for me. There is no way. I do like to get up early sometimes to write. I make my students do it once a week, so they can see the difference in their minds. We call it the “War Cry Writing Group,” and every Wednesday at 4:30 everyone gets up and does that. But anyway, I think it’s really important that we take the pressure off, because writing should never be pressured. I always tell my students that, because they get so pressured they don’t write, and then they have writer’s block. How can you have writer’s block? This whole world needs to be written or rewritten.</p>
<p>So. Read. Be patient. And trust your language. You read journals where so many people are trying to write like everybody else. So you read a poem, and there’s that one line where you’re like, “ugh,” and everyone else is like, “ugh,” but you don’t know what the poem meant, and you walk away from the poem without carrying any of it with you. I think this could be because people aren’t relying on their own language. You could write anything, but if your images don’t mean anything to you, they’re not going mean anything to me. Trusting the words you know are meaningful to you, trusting your own lexicon, is really important. Otherwise, everyone is writing “shadow,”  “ash.” I’ve been to so many readings and festivals over the last year, and it never fails — anytime anyone says the word “ash,” everybody in the audience goes “ugh.” And I just think, now, that’s not language.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>K. L. Cook is the author of three books of fiction. His most recent book, <em>Love Songs for the Quarantined</em>, won the Spokane Prize for Short Fiction. His novel, <em>The Girl from Charnelle</em>, won The Willa Award for Contemporary Fiction, and his first book, <em>Last Call,</em> won the inaugural Prairie Schooner Book Prize in Fiction. Cook’s work has appeared in <em>Glimmer Train</em>, <em>One Story</em>, <em>Poets &amp;Writers</em>, <em>Prairie Schooner</em>, the <em>Harvard Review</em> and other journals.  He is an associate professor of English at Iowa State University where he teaches in the MFA Program in Creative Writing and Environment.</p>
<p>On March 31st, 2014, Cook read his short story &#8220;Costa Rica&#8221; as part of the 10th Annual Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness and the Environment at Iowa State University.  The theme for this year&#8217;s Wildness Symposium was &#8220;Resilience Thinking in Dystopic Times.&#8221;  <em>Flyway</em> editors caught up with Cook after the reading to talk about, among other things, niche markets such as environmental writing and short story cycles.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: The short story you read at the Wildness Symposium, &#8220;Costa Rica,&#8221; was included in your collection <em>Last Call</em>, which came out in 2004.  You&#8217;ve written quite a lot since then.  Why do you keep coming back to this story?  Why did you read it at the symposium?</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">KLC: A number of factors determine what I’ll read at any given event. Some factors are practical. Which self-contained piece or pieces work within the time limit?  Which books of mine will be for sale?  What is the theme of the reading?  My first book, </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em;">Last Call, </i><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">was just re-released in a 10</span><sup style="line-height: 1.5em;">th</sup><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> anniversary paperback edition, and so I wanted to help sell books for my publisher. The story also, I think, reads well in the timeframe allotted. And the theme of the Wildness Symposium was “Resilience Thinking in Dystopic Times” and the particular theme of this reading was “Interior Mythologies.”  Though I considered many other pieces for this reading, “Costa Rica” seemed to address those themes most directly.</span></p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, I enjoy reading “Costa Rica” aloud.  It moves me, and I like to share it. I like to <i>sing</i> it.  Since this was my first public reading at Iowa State University (my new home base), I wanted to read something that linked my past to my present to my future as a writer. What I depict in “Costa Rica”—a reimagining of my father’s ill-fated scheme to purchase a large swath of Costa Rican jungle, an event that became mythic in my family’s history—was one of the reasons I became a writer in the first place.  I’ve told the story as an amusing anecdote for years.  But <i>writing</i> the story was a breakthrough for me, and the story has grown in my imagination, serving as the seed for the novel I’ve been working on for the past few years.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Speaking more broadly, you&#8217;re currently working in the MFA Program in Creative Writing and Environment at Iowa State University, and you recently came from Prescott College in Arizona, a small liberal arts college with a focus on the environment and social justice.  When people talk about &#8220;environmental writing,&#8221; often they mean writing about environmentalism, or writing with an environmental agenda.  On the other hand, sometimes people define &#8220;environment&#8221; in fiction so broadly that it just means &#8220;setting.&#8221;  How do you think about &#8220;environmental writing&#8221; so that the term is not so broad as to be meaningless, but not so narrow that it can still accommodate the limitless variety that is fiction?<b> </b></p>
<p>KLC: Fiction, which is my preferred genre, is the genre most fully engaged with a specific sense of place.  Short story writers and novelists tend to be cultural anthropologists, family systems theorists, and ethnographers—that is, close (even obsessive) observers of how people behave with one another in their natural (or unnatural) habitats.  A story needs a place to contain it, to give it meaning.  I don’t think I’ve ever written a story or a novel in which place didn’t figure significantly into the conception, writing, and revision of the piece.  I’m not sure I know how.  The environment—place—is always, for me, a character.</p>
<p>Having taught in “green programs” for more than twenty years, I’ve read a great deal of environmental fiction, poetry, plays, and essays—much of it simplistic, sentimental, overly earnest, didactic, strident, or pseudo-spiritual.  Frequently the problem is tonal.  As a teacher of creative writing in environmental programs, I often believe that my primary job is to help fellow writers avoid some of these pitfalls of tone.  If a story—or any piece of art—starts to sound too much like a sermon or a lecture or a campaign speech or a pity plea or a scare tactic or propaganda of any kind, then the writer loses his or her fundamental authority as a storyteller.  A story may teach the reader something or it may provide a distinctive moral or ethical vision (preferably one that embraces the complexities of environment), but teaching and preaching aren’t the primary goals of art. The storyteller’s first responsibility is to create a vivid and continuous dream in the reader’s mind, as John Gardner famously said, to create a shining performance, a storm of exuberantly rendered experience.  A writer, of course, needs to think carefully about the implications—environmental, ethical, emotional, spiritual—of this performance.  But I try to encourage my students to be the best artists they can be and to let their love of, and anxieties about, the state of the environment serve their art rather than have the art serve the activist.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: Tell us a little bit about short story cycles.  What draws you to this form of writing?  What do you see as the strengths and weaknesses of this form, both on a literary level and on a practical (publishing) level?  How do short story cycles intersect with other elements of both the publishing culture and of popular culture?</p>
<p>KLC: As you know, I love the short story cycle form (a.k.a. linked stories, novel-in-stories, short story sequence) and have written and spoken about it at length. (I have a page on my <a title="K.L. Cook" href="http://klcook.net" target="_blank">website</a> devoted to short story cycles, including a video of a lecture I gave about the subject.) It is the defining form for our post-postmodern times, as evidenced in part by the quality these days of television shows, where much of the best narrative storytelling is happening.  What I might add here is this: when you commit to this form, you are in essence committing to mosaic narrative design. There may be energetic linear storytelling within a short story cycle, but the form challenges linear narrative design. If you have what I call a “cyclical imagination,” then you tend to embrace individual stories as much as you do novels. But there’s a trade-off in immediate power. Nothing quite beats the urgency of a big linear narrative, cleanly and intelligently told. We’re talking about the power of causation: <i>this caused that which in turned caused this</i>.  The short story cycle writer is always, even if only subtly, trying to compensate for that loss of linear narrative urgency.</p>
<p>Another issue.  Because the form values individual stories as much as it does larger holistic narrative effects, values self-contained parts as much as organic unity, values polyphony over a unified authorial voice—then there can be a tendency toward preciousness.  Story writers, I think, are nervous about holding the reader’s attention, afraid some editor will not read past the first page, concerned that everything in a story must contribute to the overall effect. That anxiety often leads short story writers toward <i>tour de force</i> performances—often preening in the language itself, or dependent on some kind of unusual formal distinctiveness, or pared down with a radical minimalism that forces the reader to work very hard to understand the submerged narrative. Writers and readers of long-form narratives usually prefer a more measured pace, a slower stride, and a clearer, less anxious sensibility.</p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: As your students in the MFA program at ISU will attest, your classes provide strong evidence against the theory that creative writing can&#8217;t be taught.  How does one teach creative writing?  How do you teach creative writing?</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">KLC: I’ve always thought that the “creative writing can’t be taught” theory is, at best, half-baked. Of course, it can be taught, like any art form can.  The mentoring process—more experienced practitioners teaching apprentices craft, aesthetics, and habits of art in a hands-on way—has a very long tradition, longer in fact than any modern educational system. There’s no </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em;">one </i><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">way to approach the teaching of creative writing.  I don’t have a </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em;">way </i><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">really, but I do have certain principles, goals, and strategies that guide me as a teacher.  My first goal is to encourage what is legitimately distinctive about a younger writer’s sensibility: all artists need authentic encouragement. I also believe that the workshop process itself rapidly accelerates your development as a writer; if you treat this process generously and rigorously, then you get better while grappling with your peers’ works-in-progress. Through this process, you expand your aesthetic and learn very practical strategies for dealing with craft issues that may not be present in the current manuscript you’re working on but that may be useful to you in the next piece or a piece you write a decade from now. Above all, I try to speak to the ambition of writers.  I urge boldness, emotional and aesthetical risk-taking, and compassion, and I try to do this not from a position of authority but as a fellow writer.  I want my students to know that it’s perfectly fine to fail; failure is a natural byproduct of boldness and therefore should be embraced.  I’ve found that if you persuade talented writers that their desire to make art is worthy and honorable, and that the process itself can be joyous rather than paralyzing, then they get better simply because they want to and are willing to work harder than they’ve ever worked before to discover and refine their vision. </span><b> </b></p>
<p><em>Flyway</em>: What are some advantages of going through an MFA program, and what are some disadvantages?</p>
<p>KLC: My MFA experience was the most valuable educational experience in my life.  It changed me.  I had mentors who treated me and my work generously, fairly, and rigorously, imploring me to do better.  I had peers who supported, challenged, and inspired me.  And I had a community that said it was okay to do this thing I wasn’t sure I really <i>could </i>do.  I believe every writer needs those three things—experienced writers taking an interest, peers whose work inspires, and a community that allows you to create without apology or defensiveness.  A creative writing program isn’t the only kind of writing community, and not every writer wants or needs these mentors, peers, and community.  But most creative writing programs champion these principles and frequently provide genuinely transformative experiences for writers.  Even if I had never published a single piece, I would still cherish my experience as a student in an MFA program.  At the very least, it taught me how to read like a writer reads, how to think like an artist, and such a lesson has enriched me as a reader, as a writer, and as a teacher.  I feel very privileged to have spent my professional life teaching creative writing and literature to both undergraduate and graduate students.  Every semester I have amazing students who inspire and challenge me.  I’m a lucky dog.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Chloe Clark</p>
<p>Kevin Brockmeier is one of those authors who I often wish was forced to put out a book every month or so. His writing has been enchanting and surprising me since I first read one of his short stories (from his collection <em>Things that Fall from the Sky</em>) almost a decade ago. Mr Brockmeier attended the Wilderness Symposium at Iowa State and was kind enough to answer some questions with Flyway. I, of course, leaped (literally leaping out of my seat, screaming “I Volunteer!”) at the chance to interview him.</p>
<p>1.) Your writing often falls into what is sometimes broadly referred to as “New Wave Fabulism” (among other names). Magic and ghosts and strangeness seem to occur naturally in your work. Is that something you strive for intentionally? Or is it something that just comes out of the writing itself? What do you think are some of the things that stories gain through the fabulist? Are there drawbacks that come out of this as well?</p>
<p>When people ask me about the attraction of the fantastic, I always like to quote a line from G. K. Chesterton’s <i>The Poet and the Lunatics</i>, in which a character says of St. Peter that, dying upside down, he “saw the landscape as it really is: with the stars like flowers, and the clouds like hills, and all men hanging on the mercy of God.” The intuition of this passage — and my own intuition, as well — is to believe that the world itself is deeply strange but that sometimes it takes a change of perspective for us to see it clearly. I turn to the fantastic, then — or the magical, or the fabulist: whatever you want to call it — in part because it presents the world at a tilt and brings me that curious shock of sharpened vision, but also because the metaphors it provides seem potent and beautiful to me, and because the imagery of fantasy allows me to write particular kinds of sentences that I enjoy writing, and finally, frankly, because I grew up reading a lot of science fiction and superhero comics and there are certain forms of oddity that simply excite my imagination. The deficit to writing this way is that some readers will simply refuse to participate in such stories, but that’s true of mimetic realism, as well.</p>
<p>2.) You’ve written many short stories, novels (adult and young adult), and your latest book, <i>A Few Seconds of Radiant Filmstrip</i>, is a memoir. Is it easy for you to write in all of these forms? What was the process like to take a leap into memoir-writing versus fiction?</p>
<p>It’s not easy for me to write in any form, but I found piecing the memoir together particularly difficult. The reason is that I had to cleave not only to the arc of the narrative and the necessities of the sentences, both of which I always try to do anyway, but also to the facts of my life as they actually happened — and moreover I had to accommodate the arc of the narrative and the necessities of the sentences<i>to</i> those facts. This was totally foreign ground for me. I was trying to write an immersive memoir rather than a reflective one, to resurrect a long-gone version of my own consciousness and experience the book from inside it, to divorce myself from the current day. I kept expecting that this effort would come to seem like second nature to me at some point, but it never did. With every sentence, I had to remind myself that I needed to abide by the contours of a very particular mind — mine, as it existed some 28 years ago — rather than by the contours of my mind as it exists today.</p>
<p>3.) Could you tell us a bit about your new book and how it came to be?</p>
<p>It’s a memoir of my seventh grade year of junior high school, beginning on the first day of class and ending on the last. The book has been gestating for quite a while. In fact, I tried to start it several years ago, but couldn’t figure out how to approach the material, so I set it aside to work on a novel called <i>The Illumination</i> instead. There’s this idea that only big lives, <i>momentous</i> lives, are worthy of memoir, and I remember thinking, Well, maybe, but isn’t every life momentous—or at least wouldn’t it be if you approached it with enough care, enough perceptiveness? Take any one year of any one life, recount it with clarity and sympathy, and shouldn’t it matter? Seventh grade was far and away the most difficult year of my childhood, but it’s also the year I’ve spent the most time trying to understand, as well as the source of a lot of the stories I’ve continued to tell, and I thought it would make for fruitful narrative soil.</p>
<p>4.) You came to Iowa State University’s Wildness Symposium in a year that was focused on Dystopia and Apocalypse. Your novel, <i>The Brief History of the Dead</i>, is a novel of apocalypse (though, I struggle to place it into the dystopic — maybe the afterlife you portray in the novel is a gentle dystopia?). What do you think of the current fixation in pop culture on the apocalyptic? What drew you to taking on an apocalypse in the novel?</p>
<p>I think there’s a widely shared feeling that the next century is likely to unfold as a sort of contest between human carelessness and human ingenuity, and who knows which will prevail? That must explain, at least in part, the recent appeal of apocalyptic literature — but the fact is that such literature has always spoken to people, stretching all the way back to Noah and the Flood. Maybe there’s simply a sense that the world is very tenuous, very mysterious, and that something so tenuous and mysterious can’t possibly last. In any case, you’re right that there’s not much of the dystopia about <i>The Brief History of the Dead</i>, but there’s definitely something of the apocalypse about it, albeit an apocalypse-by-narrative-necessity. I was interested in writing about a city of the remembered dead — a city populated by those who continue to exist solely because they linger in the memory of those who are still alive. How many people is any one person capable of remembering? That’s what I wondered, and in order to address the question lucidly I felt that I needed to reduce the numbers of the living; thus, the apocalypse. That said, I’ve read an awful lot of apocalyptic literature, and I’m sure my interest in the form affected my exploration of it. The single greatest example of the genre, to my mind, is the short fiction of J. G. Ballard, in which the various apocalypses the world suffers are made to seem at once very unsettling and very beautiful. A few years ago, I wrote about some of my other favorites in <a title="This Article" href="http://www.oxfordamerican.org/articles/authors/brockmeier-kevin/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">this article</span></a> for <i>The Oxford American</i>.</p>
<p>5.) Can you take us through your writing process? Do you have any words of wisdom for other writers?</p>
<p>The two pieces of advice that every working writer would offer every aspiring writer are to read as much as you can and to write as diligently as you are able. Aside from that, I like what Antoine de Saint-Exupery had to say: “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people together to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.” The books you love best — those are the immensity of the sea. As for me, I tend to think in metaphors of shape. I conceived of <i>The Illumination</i>, for instance, as a set of six transparencies, each nearly the same size and containing its own little abstract fragments of line and color, which finally, when layered on top of each other, would reveal a single complete image. <i>A Few Seconds of Radiant Filmstrip</i> I thought of as a seesaw, weighted at its ends by the first and the last days of the school year, and pivoting atop the middle chapter, which is an odd little speculative digression at the heart of the narrative. So I usually know the architecture of a project before I begin writing, and I also know the title, which I think of as the target toward which I shoot the arrow of the story. What I always say is that with those features firmly in place, and with the presiding notion of the story in mind, I start at the beginning of the narrative and proceed very slowly, broaching my sentences one tiny piece at a time, termiting away at them until I’m satisfied that they present the right effect and doing my best to complete each one before I move on to the next.</p>
<p>6.) Because I feel a need to ask this of all writers: what is on your current bookshelf? Are there any writers you think everyone needs to read right now?</p>
<p>Like most writers I know, I think of myself as a reader first and a writer second, so I’m always happy to make recommendations. Right now I’m reading a poetry collection by Donna Stonecipher called <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, as well as a novel by James Morrow called <i>Galapagos Regained</i>. The best author I’ve discovered from out of nowhere recently is Chloe Aridjis, who’s published two novels, <i>Book of Clouds</i>and <i>Asunder</i>. The best book I’ve read in the past few months is probably <i>Dept. of Speculation</i> by Jenny Offill, and in the past year probably <i>Turtle Diary</i> by Russell Hoban, which is a novel in two voices, about a lonely middle-aged man and a lonely middle-aged woman, each growing less and less recognizable to themselves with the decades, who decide to free the sea turtles from the London Zoo. That’s it, really, as far as the plot goes, but the pages unfold so beautifully and with so little trickery, so much humanity, and so little sap or gracelessness or narrative prying and wedging that my eyes kept tearing up as I read it. I keep a list of my fifty favorite books, which I’m constantly reconsidering, and I’ll append the most recent version of it below.</p>
<p>Fifty Favorite Books</p>
<p>Several rules: (1) I have listed these books in alphabetical order by the author’s last name, rather than in order of preference—though I’ve marked each of my ten very favorites with an asterisk. (2) I have chosen no more than one book per author, except in those cases where a pair of books or a trilogy seemed to call for a single shared listing. (3) I have tried to be honest, which is why there are so few classics on this list and so many semi-obscure fantasists and slim, sad coming of age stories.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Chloe Clark</p>
<p><b>Justin Madson is an artist and graphic novelist whose work includes <i>Breathers</i> (a completed comic series) and, more recently, <i>Carbon</i>. To learn more about him—follow him on Twitter @justinmadson, on Tumblr </b><a href="http://justinmadson.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><b>http://justinmadson.tumblr.com/</b></a><b> on Facebook </b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BreathersComic"><b>https://www.facebook.com/BreathersComic</b></a><b> or check out his website: <a href="http://http://www.justmadbooks.com/" target="_blank">http://www.justmadbooks.com/</a></b></p>
<p><b>1.)   </b><b>What first got you interested in the graphic novel as a storytelling form?</b></p>
<p>I had taken some film study classes in high school that sort of ignited my passion for filmmaking and script writing and I really wanted to pursue that avenue as a way of telling stories. This proved a pretty difficult task, simply due to the number of people and resources needed to pull that sort of thing together.  I had been reading a lot of comics at the time, as well, and sort of came to the realization that comics were, more or less, just movies on paper, so I decided to start drawing my stories. And I fell in love with the art form and never looked back.</p>
<p><b>2.)   </b><b>What do you think the strengths of sequential art are, compared to prose, and compared to other purely visual arts?  What can sequential art offer the cultural community that&#8217;s unique and, perhaps, underdeveloped or unexplored?</b><b></b></p>
<p>Sequential art is not limited solely by words on a page or by a single piece of visual art. It exists to tell a story through both words and pictures. It is the combination of both of those very different aspects and how they are combined that makes graphic novels so very unique.  A sequential artist may be able to convey more in a single drawn panel on a page than in multiple pages of prose writing. Often times, in my own work, it is the silent panel on a page that says the most. Sequential art offers storytellers the ability to create any type of story, really, and tell it in a variety of ways. There are not many rules when it comes to sequential art, which is why it is an appealing medium to work in. I have seen graphic novels with no words at all and somewhere words exist in panels with no drawings. And, in both these cases, the stories still move forward, time passing from panel to panel.</p>
<p><b>3.)   </b><b>  How does your sequential art, qua writing, fit within the larger literary community?  Many of us at Flyway are following the growing respect sequential art is garnering in the literary community.  Where do you feel your work fits in that community?  Where do you think sequential art as a genre (if we can call it that) fits?  Where do you think it should fit?  How does/should sequential art question, comment on, and interact with the broader community of books, readers and writers?  What do you see as the future of sequential art within the broader literary community?</b></p>
<p>In the years I have been producing comics and graphic novels, I have seen a significant jump in the appeal of graphic novels and comics, as well as the number of people creating them. I suppose that says something, that there is something appealing and worthwhile in it. I have a difficult time accepting that sequential art is being thought of very highly in the literary community, though, but I think things are headed in the right direction. More and more distinguished publishing houses now produce graphic novels and promote them as legitimate works of art and literature. Did anyone outside of comics know who Chris Ware was a couple years ago? I still believe the majority of American readers shy away from sequential art and do not really give it much value, treat it like some weird bastard child of words and pictures (which it kind of is). But there is such a plethora of great sequential art stories already produced and being produced today that it’s really just a matter of time before it becomes widely appreciated as the legitimate form of storytelling that it is. And, I do like to think I am producing work that can be thought of as something more than just words and pictures on a page, something with some sort of redeeming quality.</p>
<p><b>4.)   </b> <b>Following up on this last question: Flyway loves to publish good sequential art.  But we get very few submissions.  How do we better integrate the world of literary magazines and the world of sequential art?  (Or, is this something we should even try to do?)  Do you have suggestions for editors?  Do you have suggestions for writers/artists/creators of sequential art?</b></p>
<p>I think the main issue is that it is difficult to create a really good story of sequential art in only a few pages. In four pages of prose, one can create a lot more than four pages of sequential art. I am horrible at making short works and tend to create long, sprawling stories, so I don’t know, maybe it can be done, but not by me. I would need the entire magazine to tell a good story.</p>
<p><b>5.)   </b> <b>Writing and drawing are two talents that don&#8217;t necessarily appear together, and when they do occur in the same person, magic can happen.  Which came first, or most easily for you &#8211; the writing or the drawing?   How do they interact in your own process?  Do you write first (either on paper or in your head) and then draw the story, or do you start drawing and a story develops around your pictures? Could you take us through your process from idea conception to publication?</b></p>
<p>The writing came first and is still very much my favorite part of the whole process. The drawing part came out of a necessity.  In order to breathe life and personality into the words I had written, I forced myself to draw and draw and draw and learn the tricks of the trade. I have a writer self and an artist self and they sort of work together to keep each other in check. I may write a long piece of dialogue for a character that my writer self thinks is great, but when I’m drawing it, my artist self will see it differently and scrap it completely, or chop it to pieces. It’s a great way to self-edit as I go about creating my stories. I usually work out the main plot for the entire story, and since I see it all as a movie, albeit, it drawn on paper, I hammer a book out scene by scene, writing dialogue, then doing page layouts, then drawing and inking the pages. I have main plot points that I need to hit, but the rest I like to make up as I am actively working on it. If I had every page planned out I would get bored with it.  <b></b></p>
<p><b>6.)   </b> <b>Your series <i>Breathers</i> has a wonderfully enticing sci-fi concept (a world where everyone wears gas masks to protect them from no longer breathable air)&#8230;When did you first get the idea? Was it prompted by anything in particular?</b></p>
<p>The gas mask idea just came from me doing some drawings one day, just sort of whatever came to mind. I really liked the visual and thought, “Yeah, I can use this. This could make for a cool story.” My writer self then started to develop a story for these gas masks to exist in. I just tried to really think, rather matter-of-factly, what it would be like to live in a world where you had to wear gas masks all the time and I built a story around that. I really liked that the idea of needing gas masks to breathe affected everyone in this world, that everyone was equal, at least in that one aspect. Everyone needs to breathe.</p>
<p><b>7.)   </b><b> A great thing about your work, to me, is that you often have sci-fi or &#8220;genre-y&#8221; concepts alongside very day-to-day situations and realistically portrayed families and relationships. Is it a challenge to find that balance? Do you think it is a balance that is needed especially because you deal with genre elements?</b></p>
<p>I remember reading in an interview with comics writer, Kurt Busiek, back when he was writing the comics series, <i>Astro City</i>, in which he said you have to create an interesting backdrop for your characters, whether it be the strange city they live in or some war time situation. So, I always think of that when I create a story. It sort of adds another layer to the building of the story, a foundation on which to build characters, relationships, intrigue. I always feel that my stories are about people, above all else, but without the genre elements, serving as a backdrop, I think my stories would be kind of boring, like one of those indie films that you just know is not going to go anywhere. And the best sci-fi stories are the ones you can actually believe could happen.</p>
<p><b>8.)   </b><b> Your latest graphic novel, <i>Carbon</i>, plays really well with tropes of noir. Is that something you wanted to do from the start? Or did that just sort of happen?</b></p>
<p>I would say <i>Carbon</i> combines a lot of different genres, including, but certainly not limited to, noir. The story finds the city-state of <i>Carbon</i> in political upheaval as a newly elected governor seeks to strip the rights of a certain group of individuals who live there. These individuals are Seers, people with psychic abilities. This political unrest serves as the backdrop to the story, which, at its core, is a mystery involving several characters, each with their own issues to deal with. Like <i>Breathers</i>, the story is very character-driven, although it takes place in a world slightly different than our own.</p>
<p><b>9.)   </b> <b>Who have been some of your influences (both in writing and in art)?</b></p>
<p>Over the years many graphic novelists and cartoonists have inspired me. I consider Ted McKeever, Daniel Clowes, Charles Burns, David Lapham, the Hernandez Brothers and Alex Robinson amongst my biggest influences, but, really, there are so many to list. I cannot discount the films of the Coen Brothers, which really fueled that early spark to create stories.</p>
<p><b>10.)   </b><b>What sort of projects do you have in the works?</b></p>
<p>In addition to working on <i>Carbon</i>, which I expect will take a good four or five years to complete, I also work on the occasional painting, which is a nice change of pace from the sequential art form. To just focus on one piece of art from start to finish is sometimes like a breath of fresh air.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Alan Weisman has written several books and won numerous international awards for his work in journalism and literature, the most recent being the critically acclaimed </em>The World Without Us<em>, which describes a post-human scenario of the planet. His latest book, </em>Countdown: Our Last, Best Hope for a Future on Earth?<em> was released in September 2013 by Little, Brown and Co. </em>Countdown<em> has been short listed for a Los Angeles Times science and technology book prize. Among his other works are </em>Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World<em> (1998), winner of the Social Inventions Award from the Global Ideas Bank, </em>An Echo In My Blood<em> (1999), </em>La Frontera: The United States Border With Mexico<em>, and </em>We, Immortals<em> (1979).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Elizabeth A. Giorgi</p>
<p>In the weeks before the release of his latest book, author and journalist Alan Weisman was so worried about its reception that, he said, “I actually took out liability insurance.”</p>
<p><i>Countdown: Our Last Best Hope for a Future on Earth?</i> which was released this past September, examines the environmental impact and causes of human overpopulation.</p>
<p>Given its potentially controversial subject matter, Weisman said he was prepared for anger, lawsuits, or worse.</p>
<p>“I expected it to be really serious,” he said. “There’s a wide variety of people that could take potshots at this book.”</p>
<p>But so far, he’s received relatively little blowback — a fact he attributes to the meticulousness of his research, but which may have as much to do with the seemingly inarguable nature of his claims.</p>
<p>Weisman was in Ames, Iowa recently to speak at this year’s Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness and the Environmental Imagination. <i>Flyway</i> caught up with him by phone last week to talk about his writing process, his projects, and the troubling implications of his research for <i>Countdown.</i></p>
<p>Weisman’s name will no doubt be familiar to followers of science and environmental writing.</p>
<p>A senior reporter and editor for Homeland Productions, his work has appeared on NPR, Public Radio International and American Public Media, and in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, and others.</p>
<p>He’s the author of five non-fiction books, but is perhaps best-known for 2007’s bestselling <i>The World Without Us</i>, where he explores what would happen if humans suddenly disappeared from the planet.</p>
<p>With its focus on human overabundance, then, <i>Countdown </i>would seem in many ways to be <i>World’s </i>opposite.</p>
<p>But Weisman said that <i>Countdown</i> actually grew out of his research for <i>World</i>.</p>
<p>“Ideas just come from what you’re doing, they kind of connect you to other things,” he said. “In this case, I think [<i>Countdown</i>] really grew out of my last book, <i>The World Without Us</i>, but it wasn’t something that I had even thought about until the last couple weeks of writing.”</p>
<p>Trying to wrap up his research, he said, he asked himself, “What bases haven’t I covered?”</p>
<p>Which is how he ended up talking with the founder and director of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement.</p>
<p>“It turned out he was actually a serious guy,” Weisman said. “His premise was that the human race was a nice idea for a while, but clearly now we’re just destroying everything — ourselves. And the only ethical choice at this point, he believes, was that we should just stop procreating and die off. Because one way or another we’re killing ourselves, and at least that way we couldn’t drag all these other species with us.”</p>
<p>After that interview, Weisman said he started looking into population figures.</p>
<p>“I’d never really looked too much at population figures,” he said. “When you look at population figures, first you see the enormous numbers. It’s really hard for us to comprehend enormous numbers.”</p>
<p>But one figure did stick with him: Every four days, a million more people are added to the world’s population.</p>
<p>“That really hit me. That, I realized was not sustainable,” he said. “I decided to do this book not because I was fascinated by the subject, but because I was scared about the situation we were headed into.</p>
<p>“I call this an emergency,” he continued.</p>
<p>In addition to environmental degradation — 40 percent of the planet’s land mass is now devoted to feeding its human population, with what Weisman called “horrific repercussions” from the use of chemical fertilizers — overpopulation can also cause political instability, as young people in developing nations compete for scarce resources.</p>
<p>“The idea that [people are] not going to have an impact because they use compact fluorescent bulbs or drive a Prius, that’s just wishful thinking,” he said. “And it’s only getting worse. So this is something that the only way we’re going to deal with it or faze it out, is by limiting population growth.”</p>
<p>Weisman visited more than 20 countries researching the book, finding success stories in unlikely places, such as Iran, which went from having one of the world’s highest  to one of the world’s lowest fertility rates in about a decade thanks to progressive family planning policies.</p>
<p>And despite the challenges humans will face in the coming decades, Weisman said his research uncovered reasons for optimism.</p>
<p>The best way to limit population growth doesn’t lie in difficult and controversial measures like China’s one-child policy, he said, but in voluntary programs like Iran’s.</p>
<p>Time and again, he said, his data showed that the best way to encourage population control was to educate and empower women and to remove barriers to contraception and other forms of family planning.</p>
<p>When given the choice, many people voluntarily opt for smaller families.</p>
<p>“And there’s a win-win when you empower women,” he said. “Society just benefits in enormous ways.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friday, March 29th, 2013<br />
9th Annual Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness &amp; the Environmental Imagination: The Future of Water</p>
<p>Interview by Nick Bogdanich</p>
<p>Wang Ping is the author of over ten books of poetry and prose. She is the recipient of the Loft Literary Center 2009 McKnight Artist Fellowship Award for Writers, the winner of the Minnesota Book Awards (2008), and the Book Award from the Association for Asian American Studies (2007). See more at http://www.wangping.com.</p>
<p>In March, <em>Flyway</em>’s Assistant Fiction Editor, Nick Bogdanich had the chance to sit down with Wang Pin who was in town for Iowa State University’s Symposium on Wildness, Wilderness, and the Creative Imagination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>As a writer of poetry who often employs dialogue and a writer of prose who often waxes lyrical, the line between the two genres seems particularly blurry in your case Mrs. Ping. I wonder if you could tell us how you find that one genre informs the other. Or at what point in drafting a story do you usually figure out what genre the story is trying to be?</p>
<p>WP: I usually let the form of the story decide the form. When I have some idea and when I have some raw materials, I often take long walks. As I walk I use the rhythm to take me to where it needs to be and very often, also I let dreams take me.  So often the form for poetry, for a poem, is decided in between the sleep and the waking.  Like today I wrote a poem called <i>Of Mice and Men</i>, and I’m semi-waking up and the poem just started writing the first stanza.  When I woke up I knew, I’m writing this today. As for form, because I write poetry, I also write prose and fiction, short stories; sometimes it surprises me.</p>
<p>In my last book, <em>The Last Communist Virgin,</em> (it’s a novella actually, it’s a fifty page story), when I started writing the story I wanted no more than ten pages, for that story, and then it just expanded and expanded into fifty pages. Then, the manuscript I’ve been working on for the last ten years is the same thing; I wanted to write it as a short story but it turned into a five hundred page manuscript. Every time I complete it, I destroy it and start anew.  So this is my fifth version. Even when a big time agent from New York really liked that manuscript and wanted to publish it, he wanted me to do some minor tweaks.  And I just couldn’t do it. I destroyed it.  Started completely new.  So just like a story, a poem has its own voice and personality and very often, I just have to follow.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: Your stories cover some pretty difficult subject matter: racism, rape, abortion. In one of your poems, <i>Distilled Spirit</i>, we catch a glimpse of the poet speaker discussing her work with a professor.  The professor says, and I’m paraphrasing, “people are going to read what you write as personal stories if you write in “she” or “I.” Especially as a Chinese immigrant who writes about Chinese immigrants, how do you guard against people reading your fiction as non-fiction?</p>
<p>WP: People come to me all the time and say, “I’m so sorry you went through this.”  And my book agent, always wanted me to write, to turn my story into non-fiction.  When I told people, I said maybe they are ten percent factual.  The others are all historical and emotional truths, which I think is much more truthful than just day-to-day autobiographical accounts. Often life is so dramatic that it becomes melodrama. If you just write down as it is, it’s not truthful. It appears fake.  And so people get really nervous. They often feel cheated. They say, “I cried all these tears for you for nothing?” I say, “no it’s not true; you know these things may have happened to me and to my friends, to the generation, to immigrants even more.”  When you cry, you’re not just crying for me, you’re crying for all the people who have gone through this. That’s why I’m writing this, because if I just write about myself, it’s a very small world, but if I allow myself to go through the pain and joy of millions of other people than my world is expanded a million times larger. And that’s the task for a writer and poet. You cannot just write for yourself. You have to write through the voice of others. Those who do not have access. That’s how you create this kind of vibration and energy that make connections with other people.  They call it resonance. People say I can connect with this person, I can connect with this poem, I can connect with this book. That’s that bridging ability as a poet and a writer, but, meanwhile, as a writer, when I write about other peoples’ stories, and I turn their story into my own story, I always ask myself this question: what right do I have to write their story?  And I always come to this conclusion because I have suffered, because I’ve gone through so many things, because I know pain, because I did not run away from pain. I go through pain and I turn the pain into something positive. That is my connection, my bridge into other peoples’ pain. That’s my license to write for other people.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: You spoke about that ratio: you said ten percent true ninety percent untrue. A lot of writers talk about putting their lives on stage or mining their experiences or relationships for fictive material. Would you say that ratio generally holds true? How much personal truth in fiction do you think is too much?</p>
<p>WP:I don’t know if it’s too much or not too much. Everyone is different. I can only speak for myself. I use my personal experience or emotion as a kind of springboard to dive into that ocean. Writing is often like standing on the cliff. It’s terrifying to jump in. And standing from the familiar ground, your personal story, is often a very easy and comforting and necessary springboard for you to dive into that. I think everyone, every writer, should start with the familiar ground. Then you get into this vast ocean and just play.</p>
<p><i>Flyway</i>: Place is obviously very important to you and it is to your characters as well. They make pariahs of themselves and even risk death in order to preserve their ties with home. And yet these characters are often abroad. Yesterday we met at the Casey property to discuss your Kinship of Rivers program where you’ll actually be paddling the Mississippi and Yangtze with a fiction class. What is it with your own experiences being abroad that you’re trying to pass along to your students through this trip? Is there something about traveling that makes us focus on home?</p>
<p>WP: As an immigrant, home definitely is an extremely important and constant theme, and dreams, consciousness and unconsciousness, in the psyche. I think it’s also becoming the psyche for all the modern contemporary people. Can you tell me where’s your home, really? In the past, the Chinese people all said Old Home, which is your ancestor’s home. My ancestor’s home is in the north part of China and I never went there. I was born in Shanghai in the south and I grew up on the island. I’ve never been to my ancestor’s home. But that notion that I am part of the ancestral land, really settles me, gives me a kind of roots, it’s our roots. That root is just so difficult now and really exists only in the linguistic, in our dreams, in our writing, in our words. So it’s more important for us to become much more conscious and constantly go back and examine ourselves and the concept of home because I do believe we came out of dust, the earth. We do need to put our feet, as roots into the earth, no matter how far we try to get away from the earth. Taking my students paddling in the river is really to bring them back to nature, which is our roots. We’re so disconnected with nature, with the water, with the land, with the woods. Once I bring them back into the nature, into the river, I immediately bring them back into the past history, and the living history. For example, the Minnesota River is the living history of Minnesota. That’s the white settlers conflict with Native Americans. 1862’s Conflict, Little Crow’s Uprising, and the famous Mancato Massacre that Lincoln ordered to hang about 200 Dakota men. No one knows about that. But it’s really the most infamous massacre. And also there’s the Trail of Tears. After the uprising was defeated by the federal army, all the Dakota people were exiled out of Minnesota. But all the conflict is really, if you think about it, the root of capitalism, and all the conflict between white and Native Americans, it’s all about the home, it’s about the land. This concept is so deep and in our psyche. As writers we really have to dig into that and otherwise we just skip the surface. In my teaching I really challenge students; we do all kinds of things: going paddling in the river, meditation, even some whirling movements and tai chi movements: to open up because we’re all so closed. If you want to be a good writer, you have to open up, to become vulnerable first.</p>
<p><i>Flyway: </i>Speaking about the Mississippi and the Yangtze, they come up recurrently in your fiction. About these two rivers, characteristically, is there something about them you find similar or worth comparison?</p>
<p>WP: Of course. It’s all about the cradle of civilization. Agricultural, cultural, hydraulic dams, all these things. And also New Orleans and Shanghai both are sinking.  In the pretty near future, both cities could be under water. It’s all really interesting. But, the main thing is not really a comparison. The main thing is really to link all the water system because all the water, the earth is one body of water. All the water is linked one way or another through underground network, through rivers, through the ocean. The water just wants to flow into the river. And the rivers just want to flow into the ocean. It’s just their nature.</p>
