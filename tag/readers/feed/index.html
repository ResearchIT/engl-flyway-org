								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello friends of Flyway! We are excited to have just received our 2011-2012 Anthology&#8230;a long tim in the making. It turned out beautifully! Subscribers should prepare to get theirs in the mail sometime soon.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve passed Thanksgiving and jumped headfirst into Christmas. Hopefully by now the food comas have worn off. Now try digesting some of these nonfiction and fiction picks from around the net in our latest Web Rove.</p>
<p>-*-</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2011/spring/percy-writs/">Writs of Possession</a>&#8221; fiction by Benjamin Percy (in VQR)<br />
An unsettling story that explores housing and the idea of &#8220;possession&#8221;&#8211;what a makes a space your own, or not? <a href="http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2011/spring/percy-writs/"><br />
</a></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://mhpbooks.com/indiana-library-finds-a-gun-inside-donated-book/">Indiana Library Finds..</a>&#8221; nonfiction (article) by Nick Davies (in Melville House)<a href="http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2011/spring/percy-writs/"><br />
</a>Christmas is coming up, and we hear carved-out hideaway books are the latest DIY-gift rage.  This article offers an even better idea&#8211; include an antique firearm! Our fiction editor, Lydia, is now researching ways to fit an 1800&#8217;s sawed-off shotgun inside a copy of <em>No Country For Old Men</em>. Her momma&#8217;s gonna be so happy this christmas.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.fwrictionreview.com/post/30516688050/what-we-know-by-liz-wyckoff">What we Know</a>&#8221; fiction by Liz Wyckoff (in fwriction)<br />
This story about growing up and growing apart is a study in gorgeous language, lovely use of first person collective voice, and makes us think of summer&#8211;something we&#8217;re already missing and winter just started!</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.ucmo.edu/pleiades/current_issue/documents/Schwehn.pdf">Redirect</a>,&#8221; fiction by Kaethe Schwehn (in Pleiades)<br />
This quietly paced story is perfectly fragmented and pitch-perfect in the way tone shifts subtly with each different character.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=988&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media=">The Most Romantic Story Ever Told</a>,&#8221; nonfiction by Aimee Bender (in LARB)<br />
Aimee Bender writes a gorgeous musing over the process and prizes of transformation&#8211;beauty and the beast, Angela Carter, and online dating.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last, meet <em>Flyway&#8217;s </em>creative director/ web czaress, <strong>Lindsay D&#8217;Andrea</strong>. You can find her updating the blog, tweeting, managing our Facebook page, and helping layout issue design. Consider her a behind-the-scenes editor.</p>
<div id="attachment_830" style="width: 376px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/newhair1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-830" class=" wp-image-830     " title="Lindsay D'Andrea" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/newhair1.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="302" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-830" class="wp-caption-text">Lindsay, with her most creative hair</p></div>
<p><strong><br />
What book can you not stop talking to people about?<br />
</strong>Ever since we circulated Anthony Doerr&#8217;s books around before last year&#8217;s <em>Wildness Symposium</em>, it&#8217;s been his collection of short stories, <em>The Shell Collector</em>. I just can&#8217;t get over how textured, heart-rending, complex, and epic Doerr stories are, and I recommend them to everyone. If you haven&#8217;t read it yet, that needs to be the first thing on your list. Starting now.</p>
<p><strong><br />
What book compels your writing?</strong><em></em><br />
I&#8217;ve read a lot of books on craft &#8212; too many, I think. Obviously <em>The Art of Fiction</em> is a staple. More than reading, though, I learn most from my professors and peers and the invaluable advice they give. Actually, from a different perspective, I feel most compelled to write by reading poetry<strong>, </strong>and my go-to (for now) has been  Stephen Dunn.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?<br />
I jump all over the place, sampling from a bunch of different online and print journals. I really like <em>Hayden&#8217;s Ferry</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, <em>Ecotone</em> (hurray for environmentally-minded journals!),<em> Necessary Fiction, the Rumpus, Orion, The Southern Review, AQR</em> &#8212; plus a lot more. I also love the visual art featured on <em>Escape into Life</em> and <em>Society 6</em>.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?<br />
Oh, gosh. I usually look for writers that have been on my &#8220;must-read-more&#8221; list like Karen Russell, Lauren Groff and Meghan Mayhew Bergman, but usually I read journals for the unknowns (like myself). I will just pick stories and poems at random and read them, with hope that someone out there is doing the same for me. I usually then try to follow those emerging writers on Twitter. Our technological internet-driven age means that reading shouldn&#8217;t be passive anymore&#8230;our capacity for communication is too great to ignore.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?<br />
Send us your best! A lot of times I feel like we get stories that have not been polished or edited properly or extensively. We have pretty high standards, here, and we always want the best you can give. For visual art, I look for interesting composition (in photographs) or complex relationships between visual elements. Obviously, we &#8220;like&#8221; plants and rocks and fields and pastorals, but that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re really about&#8230;surprise us with your new ideas about the environment&#8230;it&#8217;s changing at a rate that can no longer sustain a boxed-in definition.<strong></strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Fiction editor Lydia Melby reviews the latest collection by one of her favorite authors.</em></p>
<p>&#8211; * &#8211;</p>
<p>October is a time for stories about the uncanny, the unexpected, and the feared. The cooling air and paling daylight brings a sense of a thinning barrier, an atmosphere ripe for the appearance of signs to decode. And in his newest collection of short stories, <em>Stay Awake</em>, Dan Chaon gives us these stories, increasing the atmospheric pressure with each sentence, each blank section break, and we grow more and more uneasy as we read, and cannot stop.</p>
<p>In <em>Stay Awake, </em>children wake up   screaming. Parents fall asleep at the wheel. Men wake up choking, some with notes they aren’t sure they wrote, and can’t quite understand. Parents lean over their children in the dark, watching them sleep, reaching for them. Three girls sleep through their own attempted murder, and some day in the future, a girl will wake up with the memory of the presence of another inside her own mind, a voice that whispers “<em>I’m still awake.” </em>And she will wonder what it means, like the author writing, like us who read, they all wonder what it means.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to understand.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780345530370-0" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px none; margin: 2px 10px;" src="http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20120217-stay-awake.jpg.ece/BINARY/w620x413/STAY+AWAKE.jpg" alt="" width="191" height="289" /></a><br />
In “I Wake Up,” Rob describes his disorientation as “that sense of grasping, a foot coming down and not finding the ground.” It’s a sense we feel more and more as each story progresses, even worse because at first, we <em>can</em> find the ground, or so we think, as each story grows out of a heavy realism. These people are the sort of characters we expect from Chaon—the drifting, the tired, the quiet members of society who creep along in its outer edges. People who live in the wide, blank loneliness of the Midwest, who bag groceries or drive semis. These are characters who’ve all lost someone, often in ways we consciously dread, or have even seen.</p>
<p>Like the father in the title story, everyone is looking for some sort of answer. After a long struggle to conceive, Zach’s baby Rosalie is born with   two heads  joined at the crown, mirror-image faces, a “parasitic  twin” incapable of life without Rosalie’s body. <em>Why do people want to have babies? </em>Zach and his wife wonder, and as the answer approaches us, Chaon disconnects the narrative in a way that we read the whole story again, dreading that hint we’re sure we missed the first time around.</p>
<p>These stories, each told in the simple, melancholy prose we’ve come to love about Chaon’s work, mine that richness of possibility, that foreboding, not revealing what is waiting in the dark or on the other side of the door, looking at us through the window, but not fully in view. The best of these will cause a visceral reaction, a choking   feeling in your throat, something growing  in the back of your skull, “a flicker of consciousness would wink on and off.”</p>
<p>And as the answer approaches like in “Slowly We Open Our Eyes,” as “that awful, inevitable feeling…the ticking of a roulette wheel as the marble finally settles in place, ” Chaon cuts us off with our own, “Oh my God.”</p>
<p>This is not to say these stories leave us hanging. Many are well-written but predictable—<em>“</em>St. Dismas,” “The Bees,” “Long Expected, Always Delayed,” “Thinking of You in Your Time of Sorrow.”</p>
<p>Others give us answers that are there, eerily within our reach.</p>
<p>When Critter in <em>To Psychic Underworld:</em> loses his wife, he begins to find little notes—stickies in the library about cybersex, a frantic love letter on a dollar bill, a single, plaintive word on every napkin in a clean stack. The messages grow more pointed, more private, until the last is spoken directly into his mind as he nears an inevitable breaking point that we don’t see, but expect.</p>
<p>And his survival is a stronger possibility than perhaps the saddest of these characters— Brandon in <em>Patrick Lane, Flabbergasted</em>, a young man living alone in the same house his parents killed themselves in. His world is slowly shrinking, his living space confining itself to the humming fort of the electronics that circle his bed, shrinking just as irrevocably as the window for his escape. The end to this story is as final and definite as we don’t want it to be.</p>
<p>But it’s the final story, “The Farm. The Gold. The Lily White Hands.” that most evokes a sense of otherworldly, a feeling as if a person you were speaking to stared at something over your shoulder, and then   jumped. It’s the story I’ve read again and again, read aloud to myself and to unfortunate friends. It’s Chaon’s most experimental to date, and it’s the kind of story that will only exist once, a flawless sustained gasp. Chaon slowly, quietly, fills us first with sadness, then with dread, poured like a stream of cold, wet sand, bringing us the dreams we never wanted to admit we’d had, had and savored, and   remembered the next  morning  whenever it was we   woke up.</p>
<p>Because we do understand each other. We do understand.</p>
<p>And perhaps that’s why we jump, even though it’s the most commonplace thing in the world, when the wife waiting at our bedside looks up surprised, or the mother leaning over us in the dark touches our shoulder.</p>
<p><em>Oh</em>, she says. <em>You’re   awake</em></p>
<p>&#8211; * &#8211;</p>

<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><br />
Often the last book I read compels my writing, and when I feel stalled and uninspired I might return to something by some of my favorites: Wendell Berry, William Stafford, Seamus Heaney, Mary Oliver, Galway Kinnell, Pablo Neruda, Salvatore Quasimodo, Sharon Olds, Louise Gluck, and Yusef Komunyakaa. This list probably keeps going.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than Flyway) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I’ll typically read whatever falls into my hand or strikes my momentary interest. But a few magazines I return to, subscribe to, or prefer: Cave <em>Wall</em>, <em>Appalachian Heritage</em>, <em>Whitefish Review</em>, <em>One Story</em>, <em>Ecotone</em>, <em>The Sun</em>, <em>The Paris Review</em>, and <em>Poetry</em>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
They may all be super famous already, but these names would definitely pique my interest in a journal: Track K Smith, Bob Hicok, Sandra Beasley, Aimee Nezhukumatathil, D.A. Powell, Maurice Manning, Frank X Walker, Linda Pastan, Natasha Trethewey, or Geoffrey Brock.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of Flyway?</strong><br />
Read books. Read magazines. Read <em>Flyway</em>! Write and submit and plant trees.</p>

The God of Small Things</em>. &#8230;</p>]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our new <em>Flyway</em> fiction editor, Lydia Melby, is straight outta Texas (but don&#8217;t tell her I told you). Read below for more important information.</p>
<div id="attachment_821" style="width: 319px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/220038_808697576957_1520514839_o.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-821" class=" wp-image-821     " title="Lydia with Wolf Pup" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/220038_808697576957_1520514839_o.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="232" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-821" class="wp-caption-text">Lydia with Wolf Pup</p></div>
<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><em><br />
The God of Small Things</em>. <em>Ship Breaker</em>. Mary Karr’s memoirs. Do I need to pick one? Sometimes I want to read a fast-paced YA novel about the futuristic Gulf communities complete with clipper ship chase scenes, and sometimes I want to read a lovely, lyrical novel dissecting how small choices and small betrayals can all pile together for a catastrophic end. Sometimes I want to read a fellow Texan’s sassy-assed recounting of her life and thoughts about religion, family, and writing. I’m reading <em>The Night Circus</em> right now, too, and it’s fantastic—it’s difficult to stay on track with my class readings when I have such a lively, brilliant story within reach. I’ve been putting it away in my room when I work.</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><em><br />
The English Patient</em>, ultimately (or really, anything by Ondaatje). I’ve never read a more perfectly realized, more devastating book (though <em>The God of Small Things</em> and <em>The Cat’s Table </em>come close). I read<em> Stay Awake </em>this summer and was floored. I’m reading it for the third time now—Chaon’s eerie lyricism is so subtle and so atmospheric that you get that ringing in your ears.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I read <em>The Fairy Tale Review, The Southern Review, American Short Fiction </em>(please don’t shut down!)<em>, Ecotone, Idaho Review, Gulf Coast, Bellevue, Bat City, </em>and<em> Fiddleblack, </em>cover to cover, and really love<em> The Collagist, DrunkenBoat,  Fwriction, Pank, Lit, Granta, The Paris Review, The Atlantic, A Capella Zoo, Pleiades, Ninth Letter, Sonora Review</em> and too many to really name.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
Upper Middle Class White Male Authors. Especially if they’re long-established voices, have published several times, and are writing about hetero-normative relationships taking place in New York City/LA/The Midwest. I really like it when their narrator is speaking in first person present, is frustrated with how he’s not understood by family/society, and/or has an epiphany about how their wife/ girlfriend/ new baby makes them feel trapped.</p>
<p>Obviously (I hope), that’s sarcasm. I look for writers that can shock me, writers I don’t necessarily recognize, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
I feel like a lot of current short stories tend to ignore the necessity of a compelling plot to lean on other elements—like an idiosyncratic voice, or really detailed descriptions. I don’t mean that I’d rather mostly plot, but I’m looking for balanced stories—and yeah, that’s hard to do.</p>
<p>Personally, I really enjoy tension and a sense of mystery. Or, to quote Raymond Carver, I want to read stories with at least &#8220;a little menace…There has to be tension, a sense that something is imminent, that certain things are in relentless motion, or else, most often, there simply won&#8217;t be a story.&#8221;</p>
<p>For <em>Flyway</em> in particular, there should be tension between the environment or setting of the story and the characters in it. A well-known place should appear new, even alien and strange through the eyes and actions of the characters. I want to see an active environment, too—a setting that influences actions, triggers it’s one events.</p>
<p>One of my professors has a Dianne Arbus photo on his wall—the one of the frustrated little boy holding a grenade in central park—and he pointed out part of what makes the photo so memorable (besides the little critter’s facial contortions) is that she had a special lens that made the background and environment tilted, a little bent-looking, while the foreground was in realistically sharp focus. He said that’s the kind of story he likes to read and write—one where the center is sharp and realistic, and the outer edges are starting to bend or collapse.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What makes our new editorial staff at <em>Flyway</em> tick? What kind of writing gets their hearts pumping and gets them reading after a hard day, week, month, or year in Iowa State University&#8217;s MFA program? Over the next month, you can find out as we introduce each of our new editors.</p>
<p>Up first: <strong>Managing Editor, Chris Wiewiora</strong></p>

<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><em><br />
Fire Season: Notes from a Wilderness Lookout </em>by Philip Connors</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?<em><br />
</em></strong><em>The Writing Life</em><em> </em>by Annie Dillard</p>
<p><strong>What (other than Flyway) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I read a whole helluva lot of them…but I subscribe to <em>River Styx, the Florida Review </em>(of course)<em>, Poetry, The Sun, Cave Wall</em>, and I’m probably forgetting others. Also, online I read a lot of community writing like <em>theRumpus, Hobart, the Millions, PANK, HTML Giant, </em>et al.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
I love to find any piece by Ira Sukrungruang. I like Ben [Percy’s] modern folktales. Billy Collins seems to be in any and all lit mags. Alex Lemon’s poems are solid. Brian Doyle’s prose-poem/auto-fiction/close-to-the-heart-nonfiction. Steve Almond’s love/sex/breakup-stories. Jeffrey Brown’s memoir-and/or-satirical comics. &#8230;Megan Mayhew Berman and her animal stories. Caitlin Horrocks; though, she’s mostly in “the slicks” now. Anything by these two amazing Florida gals: Karen Russell and Laura Van den Berg. Lindsay Hunter’s wild and weird stories!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
Address your cover letters to the appropriate editor. Seriously.</p>
