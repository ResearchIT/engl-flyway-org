								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Annually, <em>Flyway </em>hosts a blind-judged contest for graduate students in Iowa State&#8217;s Creative Writing and Environment program.</div>
<div>
<div>&#8220;Wunderkammer&#8221; a Prezi, lyric essay by Megan White (third year) and a selection of poems by Claire Kruesel (first year) were chosen as the winner and runner-up of <em>Flyway</em>&#8216;s 2012 Home Voices Contest judged by Michael Martone, author of <em><a href="http://www.fc2.org/authors/martone/four/four.html" target="_blank">Four for a Quarter</a></em>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>From Martone:</div>
<blockquote>
<div><span>On the essay:<br />
</span><em>I am a sucker for the lyric, the non-linear. And I think we all as writers should begin to consider this powerful typesetting tool we are now equipped with and what it will mean for the &#8220;writer&#8221; of today and tomorrow to expand beyond the definition of a producer of text alone. I really appreciated the author here discovering what we might be able to do under this emerging definition.</em></div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><em> </em>On the poems:<br />
<em>I enjoyed the sonic nature of this and the, well, clumsiness of it. The mess of the poems and the attempt to revive the latinate and the scientific idiom into a poetic line. The poems themselves were like vernacular junk sequencing the poem itself speaks of. Not afraid of juxtaposition, randomness, accident, chance.</em></div>
</blockquote>
<div><span><em> </em>Both Megan and Claire&#8217;s pieces will appear on <em>Flyway&#8217;</em>s relaunched fully online magazine this spring 2013. Additionally, Megan and Claire will read during the Creative Writing and Environment Program&#8217;s 2013 Wildness Symposium.</span></div>
