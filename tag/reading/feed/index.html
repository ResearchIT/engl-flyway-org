It&#8217;s a week since Thanksgiving and you still feel full; well, how about emptying yourself by choosing to walk places within a 2-mile range? This writer took the time and effort. She considered going the distance an opportunity rather than a challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/eating-donuts-with-michael-kimball/">Eating Donuts with Michael Kimball</a>&#8221; (from <em>HTML Giant</em>)<br />
After reading about walking, health labels, and vegan food; don&#8217;t you just want a donut? Well have one as you read this camaraderous conversation with the author of <em><a href="http://michael-kimball.com/BigRay.html">Big Ray</a> </em>&#8212; a captivating, fragmentary novel from a son after his obese father&#8217;s death.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello friends of Flyway! We are excited to have just received our 2011-2012 Anthology&#8230;a long tim in the making. It turned out beautifully! Subscribers should prepare to get theirs in the mail sometime soon.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve passed Thanksgiving and jumped headfirst into Christmas. Hopefully by now the food comas have worn off. Now try digesting some of these nonfiction and fiction picks from around the net in our latest Web Rove.</p>
<p>-*-</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2011/spring/percy-writs/">Writs of Possession</a>&#8221; fiction by Benjamin Percy (in VQR)<br />
An unsettling story that explores housing and the idea of &#8220;possession&#8221;&#8211;what a makes a space your own, or not? <a href="http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2011/spring/percy-writs/"><br />
</a></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://mhpbooks.com/indiana-library-finds-a-gun-inside-donated-book/">Indiana Library Finds..</a>&#8221; nonfiction (article) by Nick Davies (in Melville House)<a href="http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2011/spring/percy-writs/"><br />
</a>Christmas is coming up, and we hear carved-out hideaway books are the latest DIY-gift rage.  This article offers an even better idea&#8211; include an antique firearm! Our fiction editor, Lydia, is now researching ways to fit an 1800&#8217;s sawed-off shotgun inside a copy of <em>No Country For Old Men</em>. Her momma&#8217;s gonna be so happy this christmas.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.fwrictionreview.com/post/30516688050/what-we-know-by-liz-wyckoff">What we Know</a>&#8221; fiction by Liz Wyckoff (in fwriction)<br />
This story about growing up and growing apart is a study in gorgeous language, lovely use of first person collective voice, and makes us think of summer&#8211;something we&#8217;re already missing and winter just started!</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.ucmo.edu/pleiades/current_issue/documents/Schwehn.pdf">Redirect</a>,&#8221; fiction by Kaethe Schwehn (in Pleiades)<br />
This quietly paced story is perfectly fragmented and pitch-perfect in the way tone shifts subtly with each different character.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=988&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media=">The Most Romantic Story Ever Told</a>,&#8221; nonfiction by Aimee Bender (in LARB)<br />
Aimee Bender writes a gorgeous musing over the process and prizes of transformation&#8211;beauty and the beast, Angela Carter, and online dating.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just last Sunday, we hosted our annual Flyway Benefit Auction to great success. Thank you to everyone who donated something by participating in one of the events we featured Sunday night. For those friends of Flyway who couldn&#8217;t be there in person, thank you for always being there in spirit. We are about to undergo some big changes, so your support mean all the more to us at this time!</p>
<p>To celebrate the post-benefit/ post-election, here are a few creative selections from around the web in this week&#8217;s web rove:</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/mean/arthur-krystal-and-everyones-favorite-genre-fiction-fallacy/">Arthur Krystal and Everyone&#8217;s Favorite Genre Fiction Fallacy</a>&#8220;<em> </em>by Mike Meginnis (from <em>HTML Giant</em>)<br />
Mike bends and blurs genre; such as his recent &#8220;Navigators&#8221; originally published in <em>Hobart</em> and then included in the <em>Best American Short Stories 2013</em>. He also defends and defines genre as way to compel plot, while also still being a good story. Have a read and then weigh in on the conversation in the comments section.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/343316/the-artist-and-the-critic-8-famous-authoreditor-relationships">The Artist and the Critic</a>&#8221; by Emily Temple (from <em>Flavorwire)</em><br />
Last fall I read the tome <em>Max Perkins: Editor of Genius</em> by biographer A. Scott Berg, which includes the Scribner editor&#8217;s trying relationships with a trifecta of the famous authors F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe. This list of eight editing relationships starts with Perkins and Wolfe, but includes seven other pairings. Throughout them all consider how an editor is a super-reader for a writer.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.worldhum.com/features/travel-stories/why-we-travel-20081213/">Why We Travel</a>&#8221; by Pico Iyer (from <em>WorldHum</em>)<br />
This is a manifesto from a transnational who has witnessed the world by participating in it via travel. Iyer shows both directions of leaving and returning: what we take there and what we bring back. Go on an imaginative trip just by reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/oct/24/simon-garfield-top-10-maps">Top 10 Books with Maps</a>&#8221; by Simon Garfield (from <em>the Guardian</em>)<br />
As cliche as it sounds for this to be a starting point on a journey of maps, this list offers just that. These books include maps on the author&#8217;s radar. Of course, there&#8217;s more than just these ten, so why not add to the list your own favorite maps in books?</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/443/please_dont_vote_for_me">Please Don&#8217;t Vote for Me</a>&#8221; by Sparrow (from <em>the Sun</em>)<br />
As the editors note: &#8220;The poet and political provocateur Sparrow has run for U.S. president in every election since 1992. Sometimes he runs as a Republican and other times as a member of a party of his own invention — the Pajama Party, the Ear of Corn Party, the Sudoku for All Party. To his knowledge he has never received any votes, but this seems only to encourage him.&#8221; Find out why Sparrow even runs, what his &#8220;issues&#8221; are, and how he never gets any votes in this tongue-in-cheek piece.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meet <strong>Lindsay Tigue,</strong> our Non-fiction editor with a love for all genres. She&#8217;s one to borrow a book from, if you&#8217;re in need.</p>
<div id="attachment_826" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ltigue3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-826" class="size-full wp-image-826" title="Lindsay Tigue, non-fiction editor" src="http://www.flyway.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ltigue3.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="338" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-826" class="wp-caption-text">Lindsay Tigue, non-fiction editor</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What book can you not stop talking to people about?</strong><br />
I already reviewed this on this blog over the summer, but <em>The Field Guide to Getting Lost </em>by Rebecca Solnit. I am <em>still</em> talking about it. It&#8217;s the kind of book where as soon as I put it down I needed to pick up another by the same author. More Solnit. I love her blend of historical and personal; the balance she achieves seems to me more fluid than a lot of nonfiction I come across.</p>
<p>As far as poetry, I cannot stop talking about <em>Words for Empty and Words for Full</em> by Bob Hicok. Not to sound hyperbolic, but I feel differently about words after reading these poems, particularly the ones about the Virginia Tech shootings. He seems to get away with so much with so little. I love that.</p>
<p><strong>What book compels your writing?</strong><em><br />
Boys of My Youth</em> by Jo Ann Beard, <em>The Collected Stories</em> by Amy Hempel, A<em>t the Drive-In Volcano</em> by Aimee <em>Nezhukumatathil</em>, <em>Among the Missing</em> by Dan Chaon. Depending on what genre I am trying to write, these are the books I need to read and reread. Without fail, they make me want to try again. They all achieve something I really want to do.</p>
<p><strong>What (other than <em>Flyway</em>) literary magazines do you read?</strong><br />
I love <em>Third Coast</em>, <em>Ecotone</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, <em>Ninth Letter</em>, <em>Colorado Review</em>, <em>Black Warrior Review</em>, <em>Indiana Review</em>, <em>Sycamore Review</em>, <em>One Story</em>, and oh so many others.</p>
<p><strong>What writers do you seek out in literary magazines?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t necessarily read literary magazines because I recognize a name. The fun is in the discovery—the heartrending essay, story, or poem by someone whom I&#8217;ve perhaps never run across before. That being said, I get excited when I see a literary magazine has a story by L. Annette Binder. I was first introduced to her work through literary magazines and I can&#8217;t wait to read her first collection, <em>Rise</em>, which was just published by Sarabande.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for potential-contributors of <em>Flyway</em>?</strong><br />
At <em>Flyway</em>, our aesthetic centers around place and the environment and the essays that stand out to me are ones interpreting a confrontation or interaction with place in a surprising way. I also like essays that feel well-structured, but not contrived. I like essays where characters (including the narrator) emerge, essays where the characters become as important as the idea. There should also be some force driving the momentum of the piece, whether it&#8217;s suspense or some overarching desire or motivation that gets me to read on. I also hate to see disparaged “quiet essays,” or “quiet poems,” or “quiet stories,” as if words must to be loud to matter. I love calm human drama. I love tension. The subtle essay that doesn&#8217;t shout can often accumulate shocking power. And, really, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for; I want to be moved and surprised. Break my heart, contributors!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">“Summer is for reading books about the end of the world”<br />
— A friend, on summer reads</p>
<p>Most of what I’ve been reading this summer could be called speculative fiction, or near-future, or post-apocalyptic, or just good ol’ sci-fi. Books about the end of the world fascinate me, and I’ve read some rewardingly sinister predictions, some hopeful projections about rebuilding, and some kooky excuses to dismiss social progress in the name of returning humans to their ‘natural’ state. Among the crumbling governments and strange technologies I’ve been exploring, Paolo Bacigalupi’s whirlwind novel, <em>The Windup Girl</em>, which won the 2010 Hugo and Nebula awards and many other honors, stands apart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/0-9781597801577-0"><img class="aligncenter" title="Wind-up Girl cover" src="http://chamberfour.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/the-windup-girl-shopped.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>The narrative offers Bacigalupi’s startling vision of a world where oil has run out, ending the days of the Old Expansion; where companies like SoyPro, U-Tex, and AgriGen filled the world’s fields with genehacked crops so non-diverse they were wiped out by a couple of engineered plagues, where technology has lead to chameleonic cat infestations and 15-ton elephants are used as work animals, and where “windups”—New People engineered to be strong, beautiful, and instinctually subservient—are used to fulfill human whims.</p>
<p>But Bacigalupi doesn’t spend his time marveling over these strange events and making sure the reader knows precisely how they came about, since these events are history in this world; instead he places his narrative in the days of the “New Expansion,” when nations have rebuilt to some degree, when clipper ships and high-tech dirigibles have become commonplace again, when all technology—from crank-fans to treadle-computers—is powered by human energy, and when civil wars and political coup d’états are again concerns as big as the food supply. He evokes a world that has, at least somewhat, adapted to its own end, and is fighting to survive another.</p>
<p>While this level of complex world-building seems overwhelming at first, Bacigalupi achieves a sense of causality and wholeness in his new world. The reader is not bogged down with superfluous details and explanations of “what went wrong” and “how stuff works now,&#8221; but is rather immersed in a completely fresh era and place which may take some getting used to, but is tangible and constant. By containing his narrative in Bangkok, Thailand, Bacigalupi shows how the worldwide events have radically affected this microcosm, allowing him to reasonably hint at the struggles the rest of the world is facing without writing a 1200 page novel.</p>
<p>He also gives a multi-faceted view of the Bangkok microcosm, as the narrative rotates among four main characters—Emiko, the mysterious ‘windup’ of the title; Anderson Lake, a ‘calorie man’ spy sent by the megalithic AgriGen to seek out Thailand’s seedbank in hope of “generipping” its riches; Tan Hock Seng, a former shipping king and “yellow card” (Chinese refugee), who schemes to regain his former wealth and status; and Captain Jaidee Rojjanasukchai of the Thai Environment Ministry, called “The Tiger of Bangkok” for his fierce dedication to the environmental health of the city he loves. These four are joined by an array of supporting characters just as diverse (but not to worry, Bacigalupi’s taken care to give them memorable names, e.g. “Dog Fucker”).</p>
<p>But the true protagonist of the story is Bacigalupi’s city of Bangkok, or Krung Thep, depending on the narrator’s nationality. He has clearly done his research on the challenges facing present-day Thailand, and offers a vision of a struggling nation’s capital fighting rising sea levels and rampant disease mutations. While each of the human characters fight for their own interests and reveal their own dark sides, it’s this hopeful, but broken city in a strange and broken world that the reader comes to care for most in the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://windupstories.com"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://windupstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/paolobacigalupi300dpi.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="253" /></a></p>
<p>While I’m partial to as many characters as one can stuff into a story, some readers might find the story crowded; likewise, Bacigalupi’s constantly shifting narrative, and one particularly daring perspective shift, might contradict expected storytelling ‘rules’. However, these characters—each of different ethnicity and social standing, each with their own complex loyalties and desires—are one of the elements that set this story apart from other speculative fiction or futuristic novels.</p>
<p><em>The Windup Girl</em> isn’t strictly a cautionary tale (though one might wish certain FDA officials would read it), and it’s not a trip through one writer’s imaginative paranoia, either. The novel is Bacigalupi’s vision of our world in a possible future—a frightening, exciting, and even sometimes hopeful vision of what happens when resources are abused, communities taken for granted, and everyone—deserving or not—gets what is coming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
